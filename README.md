## What it is

Hermes-Relay puts your [Hermes agent](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent) on the devices you actually carry. The brain stays on your own machine — Hermes-Relay is how you reach it.

- **📱 Android app** — streaming chat, hands-free voice, native plugin pages, and the full Hermes dashboard (models, keys, skills, profiles), rebuilt native. Add a floating Petdex companion or optionally make Hermes your Android assistant; sideload builds can also let the agent read and act on your screen.
- **⌨️ Hermes-Relay CLI** *(beta)* — a single binary that gives the agent **hands on any machine you pair**: files, terminal, search, screenshots — consent-gated.

A vanilla [hermes-agent](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent) install is enough for the upstream standard path: chat, management, voice, inbound files, Petdex, and ordinary installed-plugin pages. The Hermes-Relay plugin is optional for that base but encouraged for the complete current experience: Terminal/TUI, notifications, desktop tools, enhanced voice, Relay sessions, page drafts, optional Device Control, and media compatibility or metadata. Hermes-Relay prefers compatible upstream surfaces as they become available instead of keeping duplicate extension paths. **Connect Hermes first, then grant Hermes-Relay separately; the same one-time invite contract pairs Android or the Desktop CLI.**

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/readme-connection-map-v2.png" alt="How Hermes-Relay connects — Dashboard and Gateway own the standard Android path for Chat, Manage, Voice, and inbound files; the optional Relay plugin separately adds Android enhancements plus CLI and UI tools; sideload adds Device Control." width="1000">
</p>

## Quick Start (Android)

Install → connect → talk, in about two minutes.

### 1 · Install the app

- **Google Play** *(easiest — auto-updates)* — [**install from Google Play**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.axiomlabs.hermesrelay). Chat, voice, sessions, Manage, and inbound files work with standard Hermes; pairing the Hermes-Relay plugin adds Terminal/TUI, notifications, Relay sessions, and media enhancements.
- **APK** *(full phone-control feature set)* — download the file ending in **`-sideload-release.apk`** from the newest `android-v*` release on [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Codename-11/hermes-relay/releases) and open it (allow your browser to install unknown apps the first time). Integrity verification, signing fingerprint, and per-build details are in the [Sideload guide](https://hermes-relay.dev/docs/guide/getting-started.html#sideload-apk).

Sideload builds check GitHub for updates and show a one-tap banner when you're behind; Play builds update through the Store. See [Release tracks](https://hermes-relay.dev/docs/guide/release-tracks) for the capability matrix.

### 2 · Have the Hermes Dashboard running

The normal Android connection uses the upstream Hermes Dashboard/Gateway for
chat, sign-in, sessions, Manage, voice, and inbound files. Installing Hermes and choosing a
provider is vanilla Hermes setup:

```bash
hermes setup --portal   # install / log in / pick a provider — skip if already done
hermes dashboard       # start the standard Dashboard/Gateway surface
```

Make the dashboard reachable from your phone over a trusted LAN, Tailscale, or
an HTTPS reverse proxy. The [full walkthrough](https://hermes-relay.dev/docs/guide/getting-started)
covers Windows, remote access, and dashboard authentication. You do not need to
enable the separate API server or invent an API key for the standard path.

Start on a trusted LAN. For away-from-home access, Tailscale is the recommended
path. Secure Link, public TLS, and experimental routing options are covered in
the [remote-access guide](https://hermes-relay.dev/docs/guide/remote-access/).

### 3 · Connect and talk

Use **Find Hermes on LAN** or enter the Dashboard address manually
(conventionally `http://<host>:9119`). Sign in through the
Dashboard's configured provider when prompted. The app probes the available
upstream capabilities and finishes with a connection summary.

If the Relay Dashboard page is already installed, **Connect mobile app** offers
the same standard connection as a tokenless QR. It contains only the Dashboard
address and does not install, enable, or pair Relay.

The separate API server can be discovered automatically or added later under
**Advanced** as a chat fallback or for a headless compatibility setup. Its API
key is requested only when that optional endpoint is configured. Existing
API-first setup QRs remain importable.

The wizard probes everything and finishes with a capability card:

| Line | What it means |
|------|---------------|
| **Chat** | Dashboard/Gateway ready — you can talk |
| **Manage** | Models, keys, skills, and profiles are available from the phone |
| **Voice** | Speech ready via your server (or one Manage sign-in away) |
| **Direct API** | Optional API-only compatibility route available/unavailable |
| **Relay** | Recommended extensions paired/unpaired; never blocks the upstream path |

One dashboard sign-in unlocks Chat, Manage, sessions, and standard voice. That's
the whole Vanilla Hermes setup.

> **Going places?** Add the Dashboard's Tailscale address — for example `http://100.x.y.z:9119` or a separately published `https://host.ts.net` URL — under **Settings → Gateways → Routes**. Android tests it as a Dashboard route; no API server or API key is required. The app uses LAN at home and switches routes automatically when you leave. To refuse that fallback, turn on **Settings → Always connect via Tailscale** for the connection: the app then connects over Tailscale only, and shows a blocked state with fix steps instead of using a LAN or public URL. See [Remote access](https://hermes-relay.dev/docs/guide/remote-access).

### 4 · Recommended: pair Relay for the complete experience

Install Relay for Terminal/TUI, notifications, desktop tools, enhanced voice,
Relay sessions, approval-gated page drafts, optional Device Control, and media
compatibility or sensitivity metadata:

```bash
hermes plugins install Codename-11/hermes-relay/plugin --enable
hermes relay doctor
hermes relay start --no-ssl
```

Use `--no-ssl` only on a trusted LAN or VPN. Use the
[remote-access guide](https://hermes-relay.dev/docs/guide/remote-access/) before
exposing any Hermes surface beyond that network.

Refresh or restart the Dashboard/Gateway, open **Relay → Pair new device**, and
scan the one-time QR from Android **Settings → Gateways → Access → Pair Relay**.
Leave mode on **Auto** for the recommended route discovery. The same dialog
shows a copyable invite for Desktop CLI clients:

```bash
hermes-relay pair --pair-qr "hermes-relay://pair?payload=…" --grant-tools
```

As alternatives, `hermes pair` renders the same Android QR and pasteable invite
in a terminal, while URL + six-character code and `--register-code` remain
manual fallbacks when QR or clipboard transfer is unavailable.

**Next:** [Android + Hermes-Relay Quick Start](https://hermes-relay.dev/docs/guide/quick-start) ·
[Desktop CLI pairing](https://hermes-relay.dev/docs/desktop/pairing) ·
[server, TLS, legacy install, and uninstall reference](https://hermes-relay.dev/docs/reference/relay-server)

**Requirements:** Android 8.0+ (SDK 26) · current upstream [hermes-agent](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent) with the Dashboard/Gateway enabled · Python 3.11+ when installing the Hermes-Relay plugin. Direct API is optional; the Hermes-Relay plugin is encouraged for the complete experience.

## Features

### Android

- **Streaming chat** — rides vanilla Hermes, preferring the dashboard gateway (`/api/ws`, live thinking) when signed in to Manage and falling back to API-server SSE otherwise, with live markdown, tool-call cards, session history, a searchable command palette, file attachments, quote-in-reply, conversation share, and send-while-streaming queuing.
- **Manage your agent** — the full Hermes dashboard, native: switch models from your provider catalog, manage keys (write-only, masked, rate-limited reveal), create and edit profiles including `SOUL.md`, and browse/install/update skills. One dashboard sign-in covers it all.
- **Hands-free voice** — talk on a vanilla install: speech rides your server's configured providers, unlocked by the same Manage sign-in. Relay-paired setups add per-profile voice and an opt-in provider-native Realtime Agent with background task handoff.
- **Works away from home** — add a Tailscale or public URL and the app roams automatically (LAN at home, fallback elsewhere). An unreachable server gets a diagnosis, not just a red dot. Prefer Tailscale only? **Settings → Always connect via Tailscale** restricts a connection to Tailscale routes and refuses every other route.
- **Multi-Connection + profiles** — pair multiple Hermes servers (home + work, dev + prod) and switch in one tap; overlay a profile's model + `SOUL.md` per chat.
- **Device Control (Sideload + Hermes-Relay required)** — the agent can read the screen and act: tap, type, swipe, scroll, screenshots, clipboard, media keys, and batched macros. This is not included in the Google Play build. It is guarded by a per-app blocklist (banking/2FA blocked by default), destructive-verb confirmation, idle auto-disable, and a full activity log.
- **Notification companion** — opt-in access so the agent can triage, summarize, and route incoming notifications.
- **Security & pairing** — QR pairing, Android Keystore session storage (StrongBox-preferred), TOFU cert pinning, per-channel time-bound grants, user-chosen session TTL.
- **Stats for Nerds** — local-only analytics: TTFT, token usage, stream health, peak-time charts.

> Sideload builds add direct SMS, contact search, one-tap dialing, and location awareness — handy for fully hands-free intents like *"text Sam I'll be 10 minutes late."* See [Release tracks](https://hermes-relay.dev/docs/guide/release-tracks).

## Hands on any machine — the Hermes-Relay CLI&nbsp;<sub>(beta)</sub>

> **Beta.** Self-contained CLI binaries ship for Windows x64, Linux x64/arm64, and macOS x64/arm64 — no Node required. Windows also has an optional compact management tray. Assets are unsigned during the experimental phase, so SmartScreen / Gatekeeper warnings are expected.

The agent's brain stays on the host; the CLI lets it call tools **on your machine** over the same WSS relay — `read_file`, `write_file`, `terminal`, `search_files`, `screenshot`, `clipboard`, `open_in_editor`, and more — behind a one-time consent gate, interactive diff approval for patches, and a `--no-tools` kill-switch.

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Codename-11/hermes-relay/main/desktop/scripts/install.ps1 | iex
```

```bash
hermes-relay pair --remote ws://<host>:8767   # once
hermes-relay daemon start                      # background tool router — agent reaches you anytime
hermes-relay update                            # self-update via GitHub Releases
```

It pairs against the **same relay and credential store** as the Android app — pair once from either, both work. Tagged on the `desktop-v*` [release track](https://github.com/Codename-11/hermes-relay/releases?q=desktop), with historical releases still visible under `cli-v*`.

On Windows, the default installer adds the optional compact **Hermes-Relay CLI UI** tray popup for host selection and pairing, connection and daemon state, per-host Ask/Trusted/Full Access, local grant dialogs, authorized-client revocation, activity, settings, and emergency stop. `hermes-relay update` detects this bundle and updates the CLI and UI together; explicit CLI-only installations stay headless and continue using the standalone binary updater. The UI is a management surface only—chat, TUI, plugins, voice, and agent sessions remain CLI/upstream concerns.

    <td align="center" width="33%"><img src="assets/screenshots/desktop-ui/overview.png" alt="Hermes-Relay CLI UI connected overview" width="100%"><br><sub><b>Connection &amp; activity</b></sub></td>

  </tr>
</table>

Structured Windows computer control prefers a compatible local CUA Driver
runtime for window-targeted background actions and virtual per-session agent
cursors. It remains behind Hermes host policy, grants, targeting, audit, and
emergency stop; Windows input is an explicit compatibility backend. CUA is not
bundled or updated automatically, but the local CLI/UI can explicitly install,
check, or update its verified canonical package. It is never exposed as a raw
remote tool surface. See the [desktop tools guide](https://hermes-relay.dev/docs/desktop/tools.html#computer-use-engines).

- **Docs:** [CLI guide](https://hermes-relay.dev/docs/desktop/) · [`desktop/README.md`](desktop/README.md)
- **AI-agent setup recipe:** `/hermes-relay-desktop-setup`

## How It Works

```
Phone        (HTTP/WSS) --> Hermes Dashboard  (:9119)   [chat gateway, manage, vanilla voice, inbound files]
Phone        (HTTP/SSE) --> Hermes API Server (:8642)   [Direct API chat, sessions, runs]
Phone        (WSS/HTTP) --> Relay             (:8767)   [terminal, bridge, media enhancements, relay voice, sessions]
CLI          (WSS)      --> Relay             (:8767)   [machine tools, tui, terminal]
```

Standard connections keep Chat on the Hermes Dashboard/Gateway. Explicit API-only
connections use the upstream Direct API SSE path with an API key. Manage and Vanilla Hermes
voice ride the Hermes dashboard with its own one-time sign-in, so a vanilla
install needs no plugin for those surfaces or ordinary inbound files. The optional relay on `:8767` adds
terminal, bridge phone control, media compatibility/metadata, machine tools, and
relay-side voice, which is preferred automatically when paired. One QR can
configure API, dashboard, and relay routes without merging their auth models.

<summary><b>Install with an AI agent</b> — paste-ready prompt for Claude / GPT</summary>

<br>

If an AI assistant manages your server, paste this block into its chat and it will fetch the canonical setup recipe and walk you through install, pairing, and troubleshooting:

```text
You are helping me install and maintain Hermes-Relay (https://github.com/Codename-11/hermes-relay) — a native Android client + a CLI + a Python plugin for the Hermes AI agent platform.

Read the canonical setup recipe before acting:
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Codename-11/hermes-relay/main/skills/devops/hermes-relay-self-setup/SKILL.md

Then guide me through:
- Verifying hermes-agent is already installed (it's a prerequisite — Hermes-Relay is a plugin, not standalone)
- Running the server-plugin install one-liner: `curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Codename-11/hermes-relay/main/install.sh | bash`
- Connecting my phone by Vanilla Hermes API URL/key first, then optionally pairing Relay via `hermes pair` or `/hermes-relay-pair` for power tools; OR pairing my laptop via the Hermes-Relay CLI (`irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Codename-11/hermes-relay/main/desktop/scripts/install.ps1 | iex` on Windows, then `hermes-relay pair --remote ws://<host>:8767`)
- Verifying with `hermes-status` (server) or `hermes-relay doctor` (CLI)

Always confirm before running shell commands. Never restart hermes-gateway without asking. If any step fails, consult the Troubleshooting section in the SKILL.md and ask me for the exact error.
```

Already installed? The same recipe is auto-loaded as a Hermes skill — invoke `/hermes-relay-self-setup` from any chat for re-setup or "is everything wired correctly?" checks.

```

Gateway, session, streaming, reconnect, or authoritative-history changes use
the reusable, on-demand [Gateway contract lab](docs/gateway-contract-testing.md).
It includes deterministic protocol scenarios, current-upstream conformance,
Android instrumentation, and opt-in physical-device certification; none of
those lanes is scheduled automatically.

<summary><b>Running the server / plugin from a clone</b></summary>

<br>

End users should follow the [recommended Hermes-Relay setup](#4--recommended-pair-relay-for-the-complete-experience) above. For local development:

```bash
hermes relay start --no-ssl          # if you installed the plugin
python -m plugin.relay --no-ssl      # or from a repo checkout

# Docker:
docker build -t hermes-relay relay_server/ && docker run -d --network host --name hermes-relay hermes-relay

# Live-edit the plugin against a local Hermes:
ln -s "$PWD/plugin" ~/.hermes/plugins/hermes-relay
```

Then restart hermes and run `hermes pair` to verify. The 35 `android_*` and 25 `desktop_*` tools register regardless of hermes-agent version. See [docs/relay-server.md](docs/relay-server.md) for TLS, systemd, and full setup.
