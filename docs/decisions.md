## Framework Decision: Kotlin + Jetpack Compose

**Chosen over:** React Native, Flutter, Kotlin + XML (upstream)

**Why Compose:**
- 80% of the app is native Android services (AccessibilityService, PTY, foreground services, biometrics). Cross-platform frameworks would still need Kotlin native modules for all of that, plus a bridge layer.
- Compose is declarative like React — same mental model (state → UI), different syntax. Familiar to React developers.
- Material 3 / Material You theming is first-class. Dynamic color from wallpaper, proper motion system.
- OkHttp WebSocket supports `wss://` natively. No bridge layer to debug.
- Background foreground service keeps the WSS connection alive when the phone locks. React Native's background execution is fragile.
- Single language (Kotlin) for the entire app — services, UI, networking.

**Why not React Native:**
- Would need native modules for: AccessibilityService, foreground service, biometric auth, EncryptedSharedPreferences, MediaProjection. That's most of the app written in Kotlin anyway, plus JS bridge overhead.
- Background reliability issues on Android are well-documented.
- Only makes sense if the UI were 80%+ of the codebase. Here it's ~20%.

**Why not Flutter:**
- Same native bridge problem as RN, but with Dart (new language) instead of familiar React patterns.
- Platform channels for every native API.
- Smaller Android-specific ecosystem for security/biometric libraries.

**Why not staying with Kotlin + XML (upstream):**
- XML layouts are legacy. Compose is the modern Android UI toolkit.
- Upstream UI is functional but not polished. Full rewrite needed anyway.
- Compose gives us better animation, theming, and state management primitives.

## Architecture Decisions

### 1. Single WSS Connection with Channel Multiplexing

**Decision:** One WebSocket connection carries relay real-time channels via typed message envelopes. The original set was chat, terminal, and bridge; later releases added TUI over the relay envelope, while voice uses Relay-protected HTTP routes with the same session/grant model.

**Why:** Simpler connection management, single auth flow, single reconnect handler. Mobile networks are flaky — one connection is easier to keep alive than three.

**Trade-off:** If one channel floods (e.g., terminal output), it could delay others. Mitigated by: terminal output batching (16ms frames), priority queuing (system > chat > terminal > bridge).

### 2. Relay Server as Separate Service (Port 8767)

**Decision:** New Python relay service, separate from the existing bridge relay (8766) and the Hermes gateway.

**Why:** 
- The existing relay is single-purpose (bridge only). Extending it risks breaking upstream compatibility.
- Separate service means we can deploy/restart independently of the gateway.
- Future: can merge into gateway as a platform adapter if it stabilizes.

**Alternative considered:** Adding as a gateway platform adapter. Deferred — too coupled to gateway lifecycle for MVP.

### 3. Chat via Direct API, Not Relay Proxy

**Status:** Superseded as the standard route by ADR 38 (2026-07-18). Direct API
chat remains an explicit API-only/headless compatibility mode; the upstream
Dashboard/Gateway is now the primary connection surface. ADR 71 removes
availability-driven fallback between their non-interchangeable session stores.

**Decision:** ~~Chat channel proxies through the relay to the WebAPI.~~ **Updated:** Chat now connects directly from the Android app to the Hermes API Server via HTTP/SSE. The relay server is only used for bridge and terminal channels.

**Why (original relay approach):**
- WebAPI already handles session management, agent creation, SSE streaming, tool progress events.
- Gateway integration would require implementing a new platform adapter. Much more work.
- WebAPI is stable, documented, and used by ClawPort.

**Why direct API (updated 2026-04-05):**
- The relay was an unnecessary middleman for chat — it just converted SSE to WebSocket envelopes.
- Every other Hermes frontend (Open WebUI, ClawPort, LobeChat, etc.) connects directly to the API server.
- Direct connection is simpler, removes the relay as a single point of failure for chat, and reduces latency.
- The relay remains for bridge (device control) and terminal (tmux/PTY) which require custom bidirectional protocols.

**Streaming endpoints (updated 2026-04-07):**

The app supports two streaming endpoints, selectable in Settings:

| Endpoint | Tool Calls | Event Format |
|----------|-----------|--------------|
| **Sessions** (`/api/sessions/{id}/chat/stream`) | Inline text annotations (`` `💻 terminal` ``) — client parses from markdown | Hermes-native SSE (assistant.delta, tool.progress, etc.) or OpenAI-format (delta.content) |
| **Runs** (`/v1/runs` + `/v1/runs/{run_id}/events`) | **Structured events** (tool.started, tool.completed) — real-time tool cards | Hermes lifecycle events (message.delta, tool.started, tool.completed, run.completed) |

**Important upstream note:** The `/api/sessions` CRUD/chat endpoints are now in
upstream Hermes core via focused PR
[#33134](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/pull/33134), which
salvaged the useful session-control portion of #29302 and covers session
list/create/read/update/delete, messages, fork, chat, and chat stream. Read-only
skill/toolset discovery is also native via
[#33016](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/pull/33016). The bootstrap
still ships for older core builds and for surfaces that remain compatibility-only
(config, memory, legacy skill detail/toggle, available-models, slash middleware),
but sessions and read-only skill lists should now be upstream-first.

The app's `probeCapabilities()` returns a per-endpoint snapshot, and `ConnectionViewModel.resolveStreamingEndpoint()` collapses `streamingEndpoint = "auto"` (the default for new installs) to a concrete `"sessions"` or `"runs"` choice based on what the server actually exposes.

**Tool call transparency:** In `/v1/chat/completions` streaming, tool calls are NOT emitted as separate SSE events. They are injected as inline markdown text (e.g., `` `💻 pwd` ``). The app's annotation parser (`ChatHandler.parseAnnotationLine`) detects these and renders them as tool progress cards. The `/v1/runs` endpoint is the only path that provides structured `tool.started`/`tool.completed` events.

**Architecture:**
```
Phone (HTTP/SSE) → Hermes API Server (:8642)   [chat — direct]
Phone (WSS)      → Relay Server (:8767)          [bridge, terminal]
```

**Auth:** Optional Bearer token (`API_SERVER_KEY`) stored in EncryptedSharedPreferences on device. Most local Hermes setups don't require a key.

### 4. xterm.js in WebView for Terminal

**Decision:** Use xterm.js running in a local WebView for the terminal emulator, not a native Compose canvas renderer.

**Why:**
- xterm.js is battle-tested — handles all ANSI escape sequences, Unicode, colors, scrollback.
- A native Compose terminal renderer would be weeks of work for inferior rendering.
- The WebView is a single composable in an otherwise fully native app — acceptable trade-off.
- Can replace with native renderer later if WebView performance is insufficient.

### 5. tmux for Terminal Session Management

**Decision:** Terminal channel attaches to tmux sessions, not raw PTY.

**Why:**
- tmux gives persistence — disconnect from the app, reconnect, session is still there.
- Named sessions let you manage multiple contexts (different projects, different servers).
- Shared sessions — agent and user can see the same terminal (future collaboration).

### 6. Auth: Pairing Code → Session Token

**Decision:** Initial pairing via 6-char code (upstream pattern), then long-lived session token for subsequent connections.

**Why:**
- Pairing codes are user-friendly and don't require pre-shared secrets.
- Session tokens avoid re-pairing on every app restart.
- Tokens stored in EncryptedSharedPreferences (Android Keystore-backed AES-256-GCM).
- An explicit re-pair replaces older sessions and trusted credentials for the same non-empty device ID; it does not accumulate duplicate entries for one app installation. Other devices and legacy entries without an identity remain independent.

#### 6a. QR Carries Both API and Relay Credentials (updated 2026-05-03)

**2026-07-18 amendment:** ADR 38 makes Dashboard/Gateway the normal connection
anchor. This API-first QR remains a backward-compatible import and Relay-pairing
format. New setup flows should carry an explicit Dashboard/Gateway URL and must
not require an API endpoint or API bearer when dashboard chat is ready.

**Decision:** The Hermes pairing QR payload bundles the API server credentials AND the relay URL + pairing code into a single scan. The pair command (`hermes pair`, `/hermes-relay-pair`, or the compatibility `hermes-pair` shell shim, all backed by `plugin/pair.py`) runs on the Hermes host; if a relay is reachable at `localhost:RELAY_PORT`, the command mints a fresh 6-char code, pre-registers it with the relay via a new loopback-only `POST /pairing/register` endpoint, and embeds `{url, code}` under a nullable `relay` key alongside the existing `host`/`port`/`key`/`tls` fields. The dashboard pairing flow uses the relay's loopback-only `POST /pairing/mint` endpoint instead; when the dashboard omits `api_key`, the relay reads the same host-local Hermes API key config as `hermes pair` and places it in top-level `key`.

**Trust anchor:** the operator with shell access on the host. Only a process running on the same machine as the relay can hit `/pairing/register` — the handler rejects any non-loopback `request.remote` with HTTP 403. A LAN attacker cannot inject codes. This matches the model we already rely on for reading `~/.hermes/.env` and `~/.hermes/config.yaml`: if you have shell access to the host, you have enough privilege to authorize a device.

**Why the change was necessary:**
- Previously the phone generated its own 6-char pairing code locally via `AuthManager.generatePairingCode()` and sent it to the relay on WSS connect. The relay had no way to know what code to accept, so relay pairing was effectively broken — only direct API chat pairing worked via the QR.
- Pushing the code flow through the host means the operator always has the source of truth, and a single scan configures both chat and terminal/bridge with no manual steps.

**Schema evolution:**
- Old API-only QRs (`{hermes, host, port, key, tls}`) still parse cleanly — the `relay` field is nullable and `kotlinx.serialization` runs with `ignoreUnknownKeys = true`.
- When `--no-relay` is passed to the pair command, or the relay isn't running, the QR omits the `relay` block and the command prints an `[info]` pointing at `hermes relay start`.
- Top-level `key` is always the Hermes API bearer token for direct chat/session HTTP. The relay pairing code lives only at `relay.code`; putting an empty API key in a dashboard-minted QR will pair voice/relay successfully but leaves direct chat unauthenticated when the gateway requires `API_SERVER_KEY`.
- Top-level `dashboard_url` is optional. When present, Android stores it for
  Manage and Vanilla Hermes dashboard voice instead of deriving the conventional
  same-host `:9119` URL from the API server.

**Pairing alphabet change:** `PAIRING_ALPHABET` in `plugin/relay/config.py` was widened from `ABCDEFGHJKLMNPQRSTUVWXYZ23456789` (32 chars, no ambiguous 0/O/1/I) to the full `A-Z / 0-9` (36 chars) to match the phone-side `AuthManager.PAIRING_CODE_CHARS`. The old restriction only mattered when a human had to retype a code from a display; now that the code flows phone ↔ server through a QR + HTTP, the restriction silently rejected ~12% of valid codes and had to go.

**Phase 3 symmetry:** `POST /pairing/register` is written generically enough that the bridge channel's phone-generates-code, host-approves flow (symmetric to the current server-generates, phone-scans flow) can reuse it from the opposite direction. Phone-side `generatePairingCode()` in `AuthManager.kt` is retained for that reason.

**References:**
- `plugin/pair.py` — `pair_command()`, `register_relay_code()`, `probe_relay()`
- `plugin/relay/server.py` — `handle_pairing_register`, `handle_pairing_mint`
- `plugin/dashboard/plugin_api.py` — dashboard proxy for `/pairing/mint`
- `plugin/relay/auth.py` — `PairingManager.register_code()`
- `app/.../ui/components/QrPairingScanner.kt` — `HermesPairingPayload` / `RelayPairing`

### 7. Biometric Gate for Terminal Only

**Decision:** Biometric/PIN required before terminal access. Chat and bridge don't require it.

**Why:**
- Terminal = shell access to your server. Highest privilege.
- Chat is conversational — no more dangerous than Discord.
- Bridge is controlled by the agent, not the user — gating it behind biometrics doesn't help.

### 8. Dynamic Personalities over Hardcoded Profiles

> **Terminology note (2026-04-18):** The word "Profiles" in this decision's title predates the multi-server / multi-agent work landed in §19 and §21. Today's vocabulary:
>
> - **Connection** (§19) — a paired Hermes *server*. What earlier drafts sometimes called a "profile".
> - **Profile** (§21) — an upstream-Hermes agent directory (`~/.hermes/profiles/<name>/`). Overlays model + SOUL on chat turns.
> - **Personality** (this decision) — a system-prompt preset *within* one agent's config.
>
> This decision is unchanged; only the surrounding vocabulary shifted.

**Decision:** Fetch personalities from `GET /api/config` → `config.agent.personalities` (name → system prompt map). Display active personality name on chat bubbles. Send selected personality's system prompt via `system_message` field.

**Why:**
- Hermes stores personalities as system prompt strings in `config.yaml` under `agent.personalities`. The server's active personality is in `config.display.personality` (set by the user during hermes setup).
- Previous approach sent a `profile` parameter that the server ignored — personality switching was non-functional.
- Now the app fetches the full personality map, shows the server default first in the picker, and sends the system prompt directly when a non-default personality is selected.
- Personalities are maintained in `~/.hermes/config.yaml` — changing them doesn't require an app update.
- Note: personalities only change the system prompt. Memory, sessions, tools, and model stay the same. For full agent identity separation, use hermes profiles (separate gateway instances).

**Trade-off:** Requires server connectivity to populate the picker. Fallback is "Default" with no personality override.

### 8b. Dynamic Command Palette over Hardcoded Slash Commands

**Decision:** Replace hardcoded slash command list with dynamic sources. Add a searchable command palette (bottom sheet) alongside inline autocomplete.

**Why:**
- Commands come from three sources: 29 gateway built-in commands (from `hermes_cli/commands.py` — `GATEWAY_KNOWN_COMMANDS`), dynamic personality commands (from `config.agent.personalities`), and server skills (from native `GET /v1/skills`).
- The built-in gateway commands are currently hardcoded because hermes-agent has no `/api/commands` endpoint. This is a potential upstream contribution (see below).
- The command palette provides browse-by-category, search, and multi-line descriptions — essential when there are 120+ commands.
- Inline autocomplete remains for fast typing: type `/` and it filters immediately.

**Upstream opportunity:** Propose a `GET /api/commands` endpoint for hermes-agent that exposes `GATEWAY_KNOWN_COMMANDS` from `hermes_cli/commands.py`. This would let the app fetch built-in commands dynamically instead of hardcoding 29 entries. Filed as a future contribution in docs/upstream-contributions.md.

### 9. In-App Analytics (Stats for Nerds)

**Decision:** Add an `AppAnalytics` singleton that collects performance metrics in-memory (no persistence, no network), displayed via canvas bar charts in Settings.

**Why:**
- Users debugging latency or token consumption need data, not guesses.
- Metrics tracked: TTFT (time to first token), completion time, token usage per message, health check latency, stream success/failure rates.
- Canvas-rendered bar charts with purple gradient — lightweight, no charting library dependency.
- In-memory only — data resets on app restart. No privacy concerns, no storage cost.

**Alternative considered:** Third-party analytics SDK (Firebase, Mixpanel). Rejected — too heavy for a developer-focused app, and users would rightfully object to telemetry.

### 10. Command Palette + Inline Autocomplete

**Decision:** Two complementary command discovery interfaces: inline autocomplete (type `/` to filter) and a full searchable command palette (bottom sheet via `/` button).

**Why:**
- 120+ commands across three sources (29 gateway built-ins, dynamic personalities, 90+ server skills) — too many for a simple dropdown.
- Inline autocomplete serves the "I know what I want" flow — type `/mod` and `/model` appears.
- Command palette serves the "what's available?" flow — browse by category, search, read descriptions.
- Commands are grouped by category: session, configuration, info, personality, then skill categories (creative, devops, etc.).
- All slash commands are sent to the server as regular messages. The server handles them as skills or built-in commands. Client stays thin.

**Sources:**
- **Gateway built-ins** (29): from `hermes_cli/commands.py` `GATEWAY_KNOWN_COMMANDS`. Currently hardcoded — no API endpoint exists. See `docs/upstream-contributions.md` for a proposed `GET /api/commands`.
- **Personalities**: generated dynamically from `GET /api/config` → `config.agent.personalities`.
- **Skills**: fetched from native `GET /v1/skills` with name and description; legacy detail metadata is optional compatibility data.

### 11. Animated Splash Screen

**Decision:** Custom `AnimatedVectorDrawable` splash with scale + overshoot + fade animation. Hold-while-loading pattern.

**Why:**
- Android 12+ requires a splash screen. Rather than the default static icon, we use a custom animated vector.
- The splash holds until DataStore preferences are loaded (determines whether to show onboarding or main app). This prevents a flash of wrong content.
- Separate `splash_icon.xml` at 0.9x scale of `ic_launcher_foreground.xml` — the splash icon spec uses a different safe zone than adaptive icons.
- Smooth fade-out exit animation via `SplashScreen.setOnExitAnimationListener`.

## Deferrals

| Feature | Reason | When |
|---------|--------|------|
| iOS support | Android-first, platform-specific APIs | v2+ |
| Multi-device | Single-device simplifies auth and state | Phase 6 |
| On-device model | Complexity, unclear value for relay use case | Phase 6 |
| Voice mode | Depends on Hermes TTS/STT maturity | Phase 6 |
| Notification listener | Not needed for app core | Phase 6 |
| File transfer | Can use agent tools (terminal) as workaround | Phase 6 |
| Android as Hermes platform/channel | See ADR 12 — shipped as the `phone` plugin platform; unified-session "Threads" UI in progress | Shipped 2026-06-28 |

### 12. Android as a Hermes Platform/Channel — "Threads" (Shipped 2026-06-28; unified-session model 2026-06-29)

> **Status (2026-08-12):** SHIPPED as the `phone` platform plugin (`plugin/phone_platform.py`) — registered via `ctx.register_platform` with **no fork** (the ~16-file upstream change sketched below was avoided; the original research predates the open plugin-platform registry). Two-way reply is device-verified. Agent-facing entry is `send_message target=phone` (the stale `target=mobile:<device_id>` syntax below is superseded); standalone cron delivery uses the registered sender, and the adapter publishes its canonical home destination through upstream's channel directory. Live cron certification remains tracked in docs/project/TODO.md.
>
> **Decision (2026-06-29) — unified-session "Threads", not a separate surface:** the proactive agent↔phone conversation is **not** a separate app lane/tab/segment. It is a **source-tagged session inside the one Chat surface** — a **Thread** (`source=phone`). The three things distinguishing a Thread from a normal gateway chat are *session properties*, not a separate UI: (a) the agent can initiate a turn, (b) it rides the relay `proactive` transport and is relay-gated, (c) it's a standing/named DM. **Scrollback = the gateway session store** (same read path Chat uses); **live receive = the relay `proactive` push** (→ notification); **send = `proactive.reply`**. The local `ProactiveInboxStore` is demoted to a live-push cache + outbox (no parallel history). The Thread capability is surfaced in the **connection best-path/capability UI** (a relay-tier capability, like terminal/bridge/voice) and as a clean **Threads** entry (thread-spool icon, NOT a phone glyph) pinned atop the session drawer when active — never a connection-wizard step. Degrades cleanly: no relay plugin → no `source=phone` sessions → Chat is unchanged (standard-path-safe). This **supersedes the earlier "separate Agent lane / 4th nav segment" sketch** and folds in the "show chat source/platform attribution in Chat" goal in one stroke.
>
> **Outbound-first refinement (2026-08-14):** an outbound platform send does not itself create a gateway session; the `source=phone` session is created only when the phone first replies. Android groups the bounded proactive cache by connection + `chat_id` and renders a provisional Thread during that gap. A notification tap opens that exact provisional Thread, and the first reply uses the existing phone-platform path before promoting the view to the real gateway session. Once `/phone/threads` reports the mapping, the provisional row disappears. This cache is a bootstrap transcript, not a second long-term history store.
>
> **Reconnect refinement (2026-08-15):** Relay explicitly marks messages flushed from its bounded offline queue and follows a completed flush with one count envelope. Android persists that provenance, labels the affected Thread bubbles, and announces one accessible batch summary. This does not attempt background delivery after an Android force-stop; delivery still occurs only when the paired app subscribes again.
>
> **Why unified, not separate:** a separate "agent chat" tab is redundant — a Thread is just a chat session the agent can also start. One Chat surface (sessions tagged by source) matches the Discord/messaging-app model the product targets. **Two distinct senses of "gateway" to keep straight:** the *messaging gateway / platform layer* (`gateway/platforms/*` — phone/Discord/Slack as platforms; this is the Thread's `source`) vs. the *dashboard gateway transport* (`/api/ws` tui_gateway — how live chat bytes flow). A Thread is defined by its **platform/source**, not its transport; the two are orthogonal.

**Original research (2026-04-07, retained as lineage — the `mobile:<device_id>` syntax and the ~16-file upstream-fork registration below are SUPERSEDED by the no-fork plugin path):**

**Decision:** Register the Android app as a Hermes platform adapter — like Discord, Telegram, or Slack — so the agent can proactively push messages TO the phone, not just respond to requests.

**Current architecture (request/response):**
```
Phone → POST /v1/runs → Agent processes → SSE stream → Phone
         (user initiates every exchange)
```

**Future architecture (bidirectional channel):**
```
Phone ↔ Relay Server ↔ Hermes Gateway (as "mobile" platform)
         (agent can initiate conversations, push notifications, send files)
```

**What this enables:**
- Agent-initiated messages — "Your build finished," "Reminder: meeting in 10 min"
- Cross-platform relay — "Send this to my phone" from Discord/Telegram
- Background task results — agent completes a long-running task and pushes the result
- Proactive notifications — agent monitors something and alerts the phone
- The phone appears in `channel_directory.py` as a reachable destination
- Cron job results delivered directly to phone
- `send_message` tool can target `mobile:<device_id>`

#### Upstream Platform Adapter Architecture (Researched 2026-04-07)

**Base class:** `BasePlatformAdapter` in `gateway/platforms/base.py`

Required abstract methods:
| Method | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `connect() → bool` | Start listeners, return True on success |
| `disconnect()` | Stop listeners, cleanup |
| `send(chat_id, content, reply_to?, metadata?) → SendResult` | Send a text message |
| `get_chat_info(chat_id) → Dict` | Return `{name, type, chat_id}` |

Optional methods (with default stubs): `send_typing`, `send_image`, `send_document`, `send_voice`, `send_video`, `edit_message`

Key data classes: `MessageEvent` (inbound), `SendResult` (outbound), `SessionSource` (origin tracking)

**Registration is NOT plugin-based** — requires changes to ~16 files in hermes-agent. There is an official guide: `gateway/platforms/ADDING_A_PLATFORM.md` (16-step checklist). Key files:

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `gateway/platforms/mobile.py` | CREATE — `MobileAdapter(BasePlatformAdapter)` |
| `gateway/config.py` | Add `MOBILE = "mobile"` to Platform enum + env overrides |
| `gateway/run.py` | Add to `_create_adapter()` factory + authorization maps |
| `gateway/channel_directory.py` | Add `"mobile"` to session-based discovery list |
| `tools/send_message_tool.py` | Add to `platform_map` + send routing |
| `cron/scheduler.py` | Add to `platform_map` for cron delivery |
| `agent/prompt_builder.py` | Add `PLATFORM_HINTS["mobile"]` |
| `toolsets.py` | Add `hermes-mobile` toolset |

**Inbound flow:** Adapter receives message via WSS → creates `MessageEvent` → calls `self.handle_message(event)` → gateway runs agent → response sent back via `adapter.send()`

**Outbound flow:** Agent uses `send_message` tool → `platform_map["mobile"]` → `adapter.send(chat_id, content)` → relay pushes to phone via WSS

#### Implementation Approaches

| Approach | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------|------|
| **A. Upstream PR** — Add `mobile.py` to hermes-agent | Full integration, maintained upstream, benefits community | Requires ~16 file changes, PR review process |
| **B. Fork hermes-agent** — Add locally | Quick iteration, full control | Maintenance burden, diverges from upstream |
| **C. Relay as bridge** — Relay server acts as adapter sidecar | No gateway changes, uses existing relay | Less integrated (no cron delivery, no channel_directory) |

**Recommended:** Approach A (upstream PR) for long-term. Start with Approach C (relay bridge) for prototyping. The relay server already has the persistent WSS connection — it just needs to expose a local HTTP API that the gateway's `send_message` tool can call.

**Session key pattern:** `agent:main:mobile:dm:<device_id>`

**Why deferred to Phase 2+:**
- Current chat works fine as request/response via HTTP/SSE
- Terminal and bridge channels are higher priority for MVP
- Upstream PR needs careful design and community alignment

### 13. Skill Distribution via `external_dirs`, not Hub Publish or Hand-Copy (2026-04-11)

**Decision:** The `hermes-relay-pair` skill is distributed by adding the Hermes-Relay clone's `skills/` directory to `skills.external_dirs` in `~/.hermes/config.yaml`, rather than publishing to the Hermes skill hub or hand-copying files into `~/.hermes/skills/`. The skill itself lives at `skills/devops/hermes-relay-pair/SKILL.md` in the repo (category subdirectory matching `metadata.hermes.category: devops`, per Hermes canonical layout).

**Why:**
- **Atomic updates** — a single `git pull` inside `~/.hermes/hermes-relay/` updates the skill, the plugin (via `pip install -e`), and the docs in lock-step. There is no drift between the skill and the plugin module it depends on (`plugin/pair.py`).
- **No hub round-trip** — the skill is an implementation detail of this project, not a generally-useful standalone skill. Publishing to the hub would be overkill and would make updates slower (hub publish step + `hermes skills update` on every change).
- **No hand-copy** — `cp -r skills/... ~/.hermes/skills/` was the old approach, but it means every update is a manual step and users can silently end up with stale skills. `external_dirs` is scanned fresh on every hermes-agent invocation, so there's nothing to forget.
- **Canonical category layout** — matching the `devops` subdirectory to the `metadata.hermes.category` frontmatter lets users browse `~/.hermes/skills/` (and external dirs) by category and mirrors how upstream organizes its own skills.

**Trade-off:** Users need to trust the installer's YAML edit to `~/.hermes/config.yaml`. The installer keeps the edit idempotent and only appends a single line under `skills.external_dirs`. If a user removes the line by hand, re-running the installer restores it.

**Why not `hermes skills update`:** That command targets skills installed via the hub (which writes to `~/.hermes/skills/`). Skills discovered via `external_dirs` aren't tracked by the hub at all — hermes-agent enumerates them on startup. Update flow for `external_dirs` skills is whatever the external dir's own update mechanism is. For us, that's `git pull`.

**Why the old `skills/hermes-pairing-qr/` was deleted:** It was the pre-plugin bash script era — `hermes-pair` as a shell script + a flat-file `SKILL.md`. The plugin now owns the QR generation (`plugin/pair.py`, pure Python, no `qrencode` dependency), the skill at `skills/devops/hermes-relay-pair/` owns the slash-command surface, and the shell shim at `~/.local/bin/hermes-pair` covers the script-friendly CLI entry point. Keeping the deprecated skill around would have been two sources of truth for the same operation.

**Plugin CLI status (updated 2026-06-07):** hermes-agent v0.8.0 had a top-level argparse gap where third-party `PluginContext.register_cli_command()` entries did not reach `hermes <subcommand>`. Current upstream now discovers plugin CLI registrations in `hermes_cli/main.py`, so `hermes pair` and `hermes relay` are the preferred shell entry points when the plugin is enabled. `/hermes-relay-pair` and the dashed `hermes-pair` shim stay as older-build and script compatibility paths until our supported baseline includes the upstream fix.

**References:**
- `install.sh` — canonical installer
- `skills/devops/hermes-relay-pair/SKILL.md` — skill definition (canonical category layout)
- `plugin/pair.py` — shared implementation
- `~/.hermes/hermes-agent/website/docs/user-guide/features/skills.md` — upstream skill distribution spec

### 14. Inbound Media via Plugin-Owned Relay Endpoint, Not Upstream Gateway (2026-04-11)

**Status (2026-08-31): Superseded for ordinary media.** Current upstream
Hermes Dashboard/Desktop provides authenticated file download, streaming, and
bounded preview routes. Android now prefers those upstream routes for ordinary
`MEDIA:` paths and file references. The token registry remains valid for
explicit Relay tokens, phone-control screenshots, sensitivity metadata, and
older-host compatibility; it is no longer a prerequisite for standard inbound
attachments. See [`upstream-surface-matrix.md`](upstream-surface-matrix.md).

**Decision:** Agent-initiated media (screenshots, and any future file-producing tool) is delivered to the phone via a new loopback-register + bearer-fetch pair of routes on our own relay server (`POST /media/register` → `GET /media/{token}`), not by relying on hermes-agent's upstream `extract_media()` / `send_document()` machinery. Tools emit a `MEDIA:hermes-relay://<token>` marker in their chat response text; the phone parses the marker out of the SSE stream and fetches bytes out-of-band over authenticated HTTPS.

**Why:**
- **Upstream doesn't solve this on the HTTP API surface.** Verification against `~/AppData/Local/Temp/hermes-agent/gateway/platforms/api_server.py` shows `APIServerAdapter.send()` is an explicit no-op with the comment `"API server uses HTTP request/response, not send()"`. `_write_sse_chat_completion` (api_server.py:651-757) streams raw `stream_q` deltas straight into SSE `content` chunks — it never invokes `extract_media()` and never routes deltas through `GatewayStreamConsumer` (which would at least strip `MEDIA:` tags via `_MEDIA_RE` at `stream_consumer.py:188`). The upstream `extract_media()` / `send_document()` calls at `gateway/run.py:4570`, `4747`, `4349` are only reachable from **non-streaming** paths (background tasks, cron, batch) and push-style platform adapters (Telegram, Feishu, WeChat, Slack), all of which override `send_document` with real platform APIs. The pull-based HTTP adapter inherits the base class default, which falls back to `self.send(chat_id, f"📎 File: {file_path}")` — which is the no-op. So `MEDIA:/tmp/...` has always passed through our chat stream as literal text.
- **Inline base64 in tool output was the obvious alternative but blows up LLM context.** A 1280×720 JPEG is ~135 KB base64, and every subsequent turn's context window has to re-ingest the bytes. Scales badly for video or multiple attachments per turn. Opaque tokens are ~25 chars and add essentially zero context cost.
- **No upstream PR in scope.** Fixing this properly upstream would mean implementing `send_document` on `APIServerAdapter` (likely via a side-channel SSE event or a new attachment field on the chat-completion chunk shape). That's a community-scoped API change, and user explicitly wanted an in-plugin workaround, not a fork.
- **Our relay is already the right place.** The plugin's relay server (`plugin/relay/server.py`) is a service we already own, already has HTTP routes (`/health`, `/pairing/register`), already uses `SessionManager` for bearer-auth'd channels, and already lives on the phone's trust boundary (paired via the same QR). Adding file-serving doesn't create a new security surface or a new credential store — it reuses both.

**How it works:**

```

**Trust model:**
- `/media/register` is **loopback-only** — 403 for any `request.remote` other than `127.0.0.1` / `::1`. Only a process running on the same host as the relay can inject files. Same pattern as `/pairing/register`.
- `/media/{token}` requires `Authorization: Bearer <session_token>` — the same session token issued at pairing and stored in Android's `EncryptedSharedPreferences`. A LAN attacker who sniffed a token in cleartext insecure mode would also need a valid session token to use it, which they don't have unless they scanned the QR (same trust level as the WSS channel itself). Tokens are `secrets.token_urlsafe(16)` = 128 bits of entropy.
- **Path is never exposed to the client.** The register endpoint holds the token → path mapping server-side. Clients present only the token on GET, so the fetch endpoint has zero path-traversal surface. Path sandboxing lives entirely on the register side: `os.path.realpath()` must resolve under an allowed root (default: `tempfile.gettempdir()` + `HERMES_WORKSPACE` or `~/.hermes/workspace/` + any `RELAY_MEDIA_ALLOWED_ROOTS` entries), the file must exist, must be a regular file, and must fit under the configured size cap.

**Resource bounds:**
- **TTL: 24 hours** (default, `RELAY_MEDIA_TTL_SECONDS`) — chosen to match within-a-day session scrollback, the actual human use case. Going longer buys nothing since `SessionManager` is in-memory and any relay restart invalidates all tokens regardless. Going shorter breaks same-day scrollback.
- **LRU cap: 500 entries** (default, `RELAY_MEDIA_LRU_CAP`) — prevents runaway memory/disk under screenshot spam. Eviction is oldest-first via `OrderedDict.move_to_end` on every `get()`.
- **Per-file size cap: 100 MB** (default, `RELAY_MEDIA_MAX_SIZE_MB`) — guards `/media/register` against accidentally registering a 10 GB file.

**Fallback when the relay isn't running:**
The tool calls `register_media()` with a 5-second timeout. On any failure (connection refused, non-200, timeout) it logs a warning and returns the legacy bare-path form `MEDIA:/tmp/...`. The phone's `ChatHandler` parses this form via a second regex and, as of the bare-path-fetch update below, attempts a direct `/media/by-path` fetch — rendering the `⚠️ Image unavailable` placeholder only if that fetch ALSO fails (relay offline, sandbox violation, file missing). No regression versus the pre-fix behavior; the marker never renders as raw text.

**Addendum (2026-04-11, same day): LLM-emitted bare-path markers + `/media/by-path`.**
On-device testing exposed a gap: the above token-registration flow only covers markers **emitted by tools** (which we control and can wire through `register_media()`). But upstream `hermes-agent/agent/prompt_builder.py:266` explicitly instructs the LLM in its base system prompt: *"include MEDIA:/absolute/path/to/file in your response. The file..."* — so the agent's free-form completions contain `MEDIA:/abs/path` markers too, and those never go through any tool code. Our tool-only fix left them as raw text.

Rather than patch the system prompt (out of scope — upstream-owned), the fix is a second relay route — **`GET /media/by-path`** — that takes an absolute path + bearer auth and streams the file directly. Same path sandbox as `/media/register` (via shared `validate_media_path` helper), same trust model (bearer session token). The phone's bare-path marker handler now attempts this fetch first and only falls back to the "unavailable" placeholder on network/404/403 failure. Result: LLM free-form MEDIA markers render inline with zero prompt-hacking.

**Security implications of `/media/by-path`:** Adding a path-addressable fetch widens what a paired phone can request by one degree — it can now read any file in the allowed-roots whitelist without host-local process cooperation, where previously it needed a tool to pre-register via `/media/register`. This does NOT widen the trust boundary because:
 1. The allowed-roots whitelist is the same. Files outside `tempfile.gettempdir()` / `HERMES_WORKSPACE` / `RELAY_MEDIA_ALLOWED_ROOTS` are still unreachable.
 2. On Linux `/tmp` is already world-readable to every process running as the same user, so the relay exposing it over bearer-auth'd HTTP is no new disclosure to an attacker who could already connect a paired phone.
 3. Bearer auth still requires a valid session token issued at pair time. Unpaired peers get 401.
 4. The path never leaks out of the sandbox via symlinks — `os.path.realpath()` resolves symlinks before the whitelist check, so a symlink inside the whitelist pointing outside it is rejected.

The bare-path fetch is therefore safe as long as operators treat the allowed-roots whitelist as "directories the paired phone is allowed to read." If that's wrong for a given deployment, tighten `RELAY_MEDIA_ALLOWED_ROOTS` rather than disabling the endpoint.

**Trade-off: session replay across relay restarts doesn't work.** If the user scrolls back into a session from yesterday and the relay has restarted since, the tokens stored in the persisted message text are stale and `/media/{token}` returns 404. The phone renders a FAILED placeholder. Acceptable for MVP — the alternative (phone-side persistent cache indexed by token or content hash) is meaningful new plumbing and the right layer for durability, but out of scope. Filed as a follow-up in DEVLOG.

**Trade-off: auto-fetch-threshold slider is persisted but not enforced today.** The user-facing Settings → Inbound media section exposes a "auto-fetch threshold" knob (0–50 MB), but the actual fetch path only checks the cellular toggle + the max-size cap. Real threshold enforcement would need either a HEAD preflight (to reject before downloading) or accept the post-hoc waste. Kept the slider as a forward-compatibility placeholder; actual wiring is a follow-up.

**Alternative rejected: inline base64 in tool output.** Would be simpler (no new endpoint, no phone-side fetcher) but every attachment would bloat the LLM context window on every subsequent turn. For a single screenshot that's ~135 KB of base64; for any non-trivial use case the costs compound. User explicitly rejected this during the design discussion.

**Alternative rejected: patch upstream `api_server.py`.** Would be architecturally cleaner — route deltas through `GatewayStreamConsumer` so `_MEDIA_RE` strips the tags, then implement `send_document` via a side-channel SSE event. But it's a community-scoped API change, and user explicitly scoped us to "work with existing/documented methods ideally; if we have to work-around we need to follow our existing path within our plugin/etc." Recorded in `docs/upstream-contributions.md` as a possible future PR.

### 15. Pairing + Security Architecture: grants, user-chosen TTL, Keystore, TOFU, Paired Devices (2026-04-11)

**Decision:** Replace the minimal pairing model (one-shot code → fixed-30-day session token → no channel separation → `EncryptedSharedPreferences` storage) with a layered architecture built around four ideas:

1. **User chooses session TTL at pair time** — 1 day / 7 days / 30 days / 90 days / 1 year / **never expire**. The Android TTL picker dialog always opens on QR scan so the user explicitly confirms. Defaults depend on transport: wss or Tailscale → 30d; plain ws → 7d. (Both `wss` and Tailscale are treated as *secure transports* here — but for different reasons: `wss` is TLS, while Tailscale's security comes from WireGuard end-to-end encryption, not TLS. See [`user-docs/architecture/connection-security.md`](../user-docs/architecture/connection-security.md).) Never-expire is ALWAYS selectable with an inline warning — per operator direction, trust the user's intent rather than gating on secure-transport detection.
2. **Per-channel grants** — one session token, separate expiries for `chat` / `terminal` / `bridge`; later releases added `tui` and split voice grants (`voice:config`, `voice:stt`, `voice:tts`). Blast-radius-heavy channels can have shorter caps, and all grants are clamped to the session lifetime. Chat runs through the hermes-agent API server rather than the relay, so the chat grant is informational only (used by the phone UI to show scope).
3. **Hardware-backed token storage with graceful fallback** — `KeystoreTokenStore` requests StrongBox-backed keys via `setRequestStrongBoxBacked(true)` on Android 9+ devices that advertise `FEATURE_STRONGBOX_KEYSTORE`. Falls back to the existing `LegacyEncryptedPrefsTokenStore` (TEE-backed `EncryptedSharedPreferences`) on older devices or when the Keystore path throws. Migration is one-shot and lossless — users never lose a session to an app upgrade.
4. **TOFU cert pinning with explicit reset on re-pair** — `CertPinStore` records SHA-256 SPKI fingerprints per `host:port` on the first successful wss connect. Subsequent connects build an OkHttp `CertificatePinner` from the stored pin. A user-initiated QR re-pair (`applyServerIssuedCodeAndReset(code, relayUrl)`) wipes the pin for the target host — re-pair is explicit consent to potentially-new cert material. Plaintext ws:// short-circuits pinning entirely.

**Supporting infrastructure:**

- **Device revocation UI** — new Paired Devices screen on the phone, backed by `GET /sessions` (list all paired devices, tokens masked to first 8 chars) and `DELETE /sessions/{token_prefix}` (revoke). Self-revoke is allowed and flagged via `revoked_self: true` so the phone can wipe local state and redirect to pairing.
- **QR payload v2 + HMAC signing** — payload version bumped from 1 to 2 when Relay metadata fields are present (`ttl_seconds`, `grants`, `transport_hint`). Signed with HMAC-SHA256 using a host-local secret at `~/.hermes/hermes-relay-qr-secret` (32 bytes, `0o600`, auto-created). Phone parses and stores the `sig` field but does NOT verify it yet — full verification requires a secret-distribution mechanism we don't have defined. The server-side infrastructure is in place so phone-side verification can land in a follow-up.
- **Rate-limit clear on pair** — `/pairing/register` now calls `RateLimiter.clear_all_blocks()` on success. An operator explicitly re-pairing wants a clean slate; the stale rate-limit state otherwise blocks the legitimate re-pair attempt for 5 minutes. This was an actual bug biting the operator at the start of this session.
- **Transport security UI** — badge component with three states (secure green 🔒 / insecure amber with reason / insecure unknown red), three sizes (chip / row / large). Rendered in Settings Connection section, Session info sheet, and on each Paired Device card.
- **Insecure ack dialog** — first-time toggle-on shows a plain-language threat-model dialog with a reason picker (LAN only / Tailscale or VPN / Local dev only). Reason persists for display purposes; does NOT gate anything per the operator's trust-model direction.
- **Tailscale detection** — `TailscaleDetector` checks for `tailscale0` interface + `100.64.0.0/10` CGNAT addresses + `.ts.net` hostnames in the relay URL. Shown as a "Tailscale detected" green chip; **does NOT auto-change** any defaults — informational only.
- **Phase 3 bidirectional pairing stub** — new `POST /pairing/approve` route, loopback-only, same shape as `/pairing/register`. Marked with `# TODO(Phase 3):` — full flow needs a pending-codes store so operators review rather than rubber-stamp. The route and wire shape are committed now so the phone side has something to target when bridge lands.

**Why this split:**

- **Grants on a single token (not multiple tokens)** — one WSS connection, one auth envelope, one session lookup. Per-channel expiry is checked at channel message dispatch time via `Session.channel_is_expired(name)`. Simpler to reason about than multiple parallel tokens, and the phone only needs one storage slot.
- **`math.inf` for never-expire** — represents "truly unbounded" in code, serializes to `null` on the wire (JSON doesn't have an infinity literal, and null maps cleanly to Kotlin's nullable `Long?`). `canonicalize()` uses `allow_nan=False` so accidentally trying to sign a payload with a raw `math.inf` crashes loudly — callers must explicitly emit `None`/`0`. Prevents silent serialization bugs.
- **Metadata on pairing entries is host-authoritative** — when the host operator runs `hermes pair --ttl 7d` and the phone sends `ttl_seconds=30d` in the auth envelope (because the user picked a different value on the TTL dialog), the host value wins. If host metadata is absent, the relay uses bounded server defaults; network clients never author session lifetime or grants. The legacy anonymous `POST /pairing` code-mint route is intentionally not registered, so every accepted code originates from a loopback-only operator flow.
- **Bearer session-policy changes are monotonic and self-only** — a Relay bearer may use `PATCH /sessions/{token_prefix}` only for its own token and only to shorten its session or grants. It cannot add grant names, lengthen a grant, switch to never-expire, or modify another session. Those authority-increasing changes require a fresh operator-approved pairing flow.
- **Token prefix (not full token) in `/sessions` responses** — a caller already holds their own full token; they should never see another session's full token. First 8 chars are enough to identify devices in a practical deployment (one operator, 1-3 phones) and enough entropy to avoid collisions. Collisions return 409 with the match count.
- **Always open the TTL picker (no skip)** — even when the QR carries an operator-chosen TTL, the dialog opens with that value preselected. The user is always in the loop for the trust decision. A future "don't ask again if QR specifies a TTL" toggle is a plausible refinement but not in this cut.

**Trade-offs:**

- **Any paired phone can revoke any other paired device.** A compromised phone could lock out all other devices — DoS territory. Acceptable for the single-operator / 1-2 phones deployment model; multi-user deployments will need a per-device role model (admin vs user) with per-role grant caps.
- **QR signatures aren't verified on the phone.** Raises the bar for QR tampering on the server side (attacker can't inject a fake code via a modified photo if the server requires a valid sig), but the phone currently trusts any signature as long as the parse succeeds. Full verification is a follow-up.
- **TOFU cert pinning doesn't protect the first connect.** By definition, trust-on-first-use accepts whatever certificate is present on the initial handshake. Protects against MITM of subsequent connects only. Acceptable for LAN / Tailscale / VPN deployments where the first connect happens over a trusted path.
- **StrongBox is opportunistic.** Older Android devices or devices without StrongBox hardware fall back to TEE-backed EncryptedSharedPreferences. Still strong, but the attack surface is larger than hardware-backed.

**Alternatives rejected:**

- **Separate tokens per channel** — clean model but triples the storage + auth flow. One-token-with-grants is the right abstraction.
- **Gating never-expire on secure transport detection** — operator explicitly requested "don't force check, just allow based on user intent." User agency over policy.
- **Full QR signature verification on the phone in this cut** — requires a secret distribution mechanism (pre-shared key? enrollment token? OAuth?) that isn't yet designed. Server-side signing is the prerequisite and it's in place.

## CI/CD Patterns (from ARC)

Adopting from ARC's workflow patterns:

1. **CI workflow:** Lint (ktlint) → Build (debug + release matrix) → Test → Upload APK artifact
2. **Release workflow:** Tag `v*` → version validation (build.gradle.kts vs tag) → signed APK → GitHub Release
3. **Concurrency groups:** Cancel in-progress CI on new push to same branch
4. **Dependabot:** Auto-merge minor/patch dependency updates

### 16. Runtime API Server Patch via .pth Bootstrap (2026-04-12)

**Context:** The Android app depends on API-server routes for session history,
profile/config metadata, skills, and memory-backed UI. Upstream core moved in
focused pieces rather than one large frontend API patch: PR
[#33134](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/pull/33134) now covers the
canonical `/api/sessions/*` surface, and PR
[#33016](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/pull/33016) covers
read-only `/v1/skills` + `/v1/toolsets`. Config, memory, legacy skill
detail/toggle, available-models, and slash-command preprocessing still remain
compatibility routes in this repo until core exposes stable equivalents or the
local UI no longer depends on them. Without the bootstrap, users on older
vanilla upstream builds lose session browsing, metadata-backed settings, and
history-on-restart behavior.

We considered four options:
- **A. Stay fork-only.** Reject vanilla upstream users until the relevant core API surfaces land. Penalises onboarding.
- **B. Read-only sessions browser via plugin relay.** Add `GET /api/sessions/*` to the relay at port 8767. Forces the client to know which URL each operation goes to.
- **C. Full parity by porting all 800 lines onto the plugin relay.** Same architectural pollution as B, plus duplicates ~250 lines of chat-stream handler with cross-cutting `_create_agent` / `run_conversation` dependencies that the fork may have implicitly modified.
- **D. Runtime injection via Python interpreter startup hook.** Ship a `.pth` file in the venv site-packages that imports a bootstrap module, which installs a `sys.meta_path` finder for `aiohttp.web`. When the gateway eventually imports `aiohttp.web`, our finder wraps the loader and replaces `web.Application` with a thin subclass. The subclass overrides `__setitem__` to detect `app["api_server_adapter"] = self` (the line in upstream's `connect()` that gives us a reference to the adapter while the router is still mutable). At that point we register only missing method/path handlers directly onto the same router the gateway is in the middle of populating.

**Decision: D, scoped to management endpoints only.** The chat-stream handler is intentionally NOT injected — chat goes through vanilla upstream Hermes `/v1/runs`, which already emits structured `tool.started`/`tool.completed` events. This avoids touching `_create_agent` / `run_conversation` (the fork's riskiest cross-cutting dependencies) and is arguably an upgrade — `/v1/runs` has live tool events whereas the sessions chat-stream path required a post-stream message-history reload to render tool cards.

**Why this is the right answer despite being a clever hack:**

1. **Zero modifications to hermes-agent's filesystem.** `git pull` / `hermes update` see no local changes, so they always work cleanly. The patch lives entirely in `hermes_relay_bootstrap/` inside our own repo.
2. **Single-file containment of all ported logic.** `_handlers.py` is 500 lines of straight-line aiohttp handler code with explicit `adapter` parameters (closures, not bound methods). Easy to audit, easy to delete.
3. **Feature detection by method/path, not broad route family.** Native upstream
   routes win one method/path at a time. This matters because #33134 landed
   `/api/sessions/*` before core had stable config/memory/legacy skill APIs; the
   bootstrap must not skip those remaining compatibility routes just because a
   sessions route exists.
4. **Trust model already established.** The user installed our plugin into their hermes-agent venv. They've already consented to having the plugin import hermes-agent internals (it does this for relay tools, voice endpoints, media registry). Monkey-patching `aiohttp.web.Application` is in the same trust bucket.
5. **Surface-by-surface removal.** With #33134/#33016 merged, sessions and
   read-only skill lists should go quiet automatically on current upstream.
   Config, memory, legacy skill detail/toggle, available-models, and command
   preprocessing remain until their native replacements exist or the local UI
   stops depending on them. Full bootstrap deletion happens only after every
   compatibility route group has a stable core equivalent or a deliberate local
   removal.
6. **`/v1/runs` remains the fallback run-control path.** Native
   `/api/sessions/{id}/chat/stream` is now the preferred session-persisted chat
   path when advertised. `/v1/runs` still matters for async run lifecycle/control
   and for older builds without native sessions chat.

**The Android client adapts via `streamingEndpoint = "auto"`.** `ServerCapabilities` returned by `HermesApiClient.probeCapabilities()` captures per-endpoint presence (`sessionsApi`, `sessionsChatStream`, `runs`, `portable`, `healthy`). `ConnectionViewModel.resolveStreamingEndpoint()` collapses `"auto"` to `"sessions"` when native session chat is present, then falls back to OpenAI-compatible completions or runs according to the probe. The setting still supports manual `"sessions"` / `"completions"` / `"runs"` overrides for debugging.

**Risks accepted:**
- **Plugin load order** — verified: `.pth` files are processed by Python's `site` module BEFORE any application code runs, so our import hook is in place before hermes-agent imports `aiohttp.web`.
- **Upstream refactor of the route-registration block in `connect()`** — handled by feature detection on route path. Worst case: bootstrap logs a warning and gateway runs without injected routes. The Android client falls back to `/v1/runs` automatically.
- **Upstream symbol removal in `tools/skills_tool.py`** — `skills_categories` was removed in upstream commit `8d023e43` as dead code. The bootstrap no longer imports or re-injects it. The app uses `/api/skills?category=` for category filtering; the standalone `/api/skills/categories` endpoint was never called by the app. The bootstrap stays in sync with upstream by not re-introducing removed symbols.
- **Editable pip install doesn't ship `.pth` files reliably** — verified empirically (test in `/tmp/pth-test` on the server during scoping). Solved by `install.sh` copying the `.pth` directly into the venv's `site-packages/` after `pip install -e`.

**File locations:**
- `hermes_relay_bootstrap/__init__.py` — installs the meta_path finder (~30 lines)
- `hermes_relay_bootstrap/_patch.py` — `_AioHttpWebFinder`, `_PatchingLoader`, `_PatchedApplication`, `_maybe_register_routes` (~170 lines)
- `hermes_relay_bootstrap/_handlers.py` — 14 ported handlers + helpers (~500 lines)
- `hermes_relay_bootstrap.pth` — single line: `import hermes_relay_bootstrap`
- `install.sh` step 2 — copies the `.pth` into the venv site-packages

**Removal path** is now per surface:
1. Sessions: **done (2026-07-08, HRUI-002).** The sessions CRUD/messages/fork
   handlers were removed from the bootstrap with no pre-#33134 fallback kept;
   native `/api/sessions/*` (#33134) is the only provider. Older core builds
   degrade via the client capability probe to `/v1/chat/completions`/`/v1/runs`.
2. Read-only skills/toolsets: **done (2026-07-08, HRUI-002).** The legacy
   `GET /api/skills` list handler was removed; clients use native `/v1/skills`
   and `/v1/toolsets` (#33016). Legacy detail (`/api/skills/{name}`) and the
   501 toggle stub remain — no native equivalent exists.
3. Config/memory/available-models/session search: remove those compatibility
   handlers only after stable core APIs exist or the dependent Android surfaces
   are redesigned. While they remain, session search is offloaded through
   upstream `AsyncSessionDB` (or `asyncio.to_thread` on older Hermes), and each
   memory mutation request resets the optional upstream per-turn consolidation
   failure budget so independent REST calls cannot consume one shared budget.
4. Slash middleware: remove after native API-server slash preprocessing exists.
5. Full cleanup: delete `hermes_relay_bootstrap/`, delete
   `hermes_relay_bootstrap.pth`, remove the `.pth` install block, and update
   local agent docs only after all compatibility groups have native replacements.
6. The Android client `probeCapabilities()` and `streamingEndpoint = "auto"` plumbing stays — it's permanent infrastructure that handles mixed-version deployments.

### 17. Wake-lock wrapping for gesture dispatch + multi-window ScreenReader + three-tier tapText cascade (2026-04-13)

**Context:** While scoping the v0.4 bridge feature expansion (see `docs/plans/2026-04-13-bridge-feature-expansion.md`), three reliability gaps in the existing Phase 3 `ActionExecutor` / `ScreenReader` surfaced as hard prerequisites before any of the ten Tier A tools were worth adding:

1. **Gestures silently fail when the phone screen is off.** `ActionExecutor.tap` / `swipe` / `typeText` all dispatch into `GestureDescription` via the accessibility service. When the screen is off the gesture completes cleanly at the framework level — `GestureResultCallback.onCompleted` fires — but nothing actually happens on-device. The agent thinks the tap landed and proceeds with the next step. Biting Bailey repeatedly during `android_navigate` loops that sat idle between iterations.
2. **`ScreenReader` misses every overlay, popup menu, notification shade, and split-screen secondary window.** The existing implementation calls `service.rootInActiveWindow` and walks a single tree. Android exposes all visible windows via `AccessibilityService.windows`; system overlays and popup menus live in separate windows from the foreground activity. Any agent flow that needed to see a popup dialog (date pickers, confirmation dialogs, context menus, notification shade content) hit a blank tree.
3. **`ActionExecutor.tapText` fails on clickable text inside non-clickable wrappers.** The single-shot implementation finds a text node via `findNodeBoundsByText` and calls `performAction(ACTION_CLICK)` on that node. Real-world Android apps (Uber, Spotify, Instagram, Tinder — verified by comparison-passing raulvidis/hermes-android against a matrix of target apps) wrap clickable content in non-clickable `TextView`/`ImageView` ancestors. `ACTION_CLICK` on the text node itself is a no-op. The fallback approach is to walk up the parent chain to the nearest clickable ancestor, and if nothing clickable is found, fall back to a coordinate tap at the node's bounds center.

**Decision:** Adopt all three patterns before shipping the v0.4 tool surface. They're applied to the existing Phase 3 code so every new Tier A/B/C tool inherits them for free.

**Pattern 1 — `WakeLockManager.wakeForAction` (A8).** New `object WakeLockManager` at `app/src/main/kotlin/com/hermesandroid/relay/power/WakeLockManager.kt`. Exposes `suspend fun <T> wakeForAction(block: suspend () -> T): T`. Uses `PowerManager.PARTIAL_WAKE_LOCK` (the non-deprecated modern successor to `SCREEN_BRIGHT_WAKE_LOCK`), with:
- **Ref counting.** A private `lockCount: Int` tracks concurrent scopes; the underlying `WakeLock.release()` only fires when the count hits zero. Nested calls don't release each other prematurely.
- **Hard 10-second timeout.** Passed to `newWakeLock().acquire(timeoutMillis = 10_000)` as a battery safety rail. Long-held wake locks are a notorious source of drain bugs; 10s is longer than any single gesture needs and far shorter than any plausible leak window.
- **Try/finally release.** The `wakeForAction` body is wrapped in `try { block() } finally { release() }` so exceptions thrown from inside the action still release the lock.

`ActionExecutor.tap` / `tapText` / `typeText` / `swipe` / `scroll` / `longPress` / `drag` (the last two new in v0.4) are wrapped in `WakeLockManager.wakeForAction { ... }`. **Read-only calls are deliberately NOT wrapped** — `readScreen`, `findNodes`, `describeNode`, `screenHash`, `diffScreen`, `currentApp`, `clipboardRead/Write`, `mediaControl`. These don't need the screen on; wrapping them would waste battery and add latency to polls. Requires `android.permission.WAKE_LOCK` in `app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.

**Pattern 2 — Multi-window `ScreenReader` (P1).** Change `ScreenReader.readCurrentScreen` (and any helper using `rootInActiveWindow`) to iterate `service.windows.mapNotNull { it.root }` and walk each per-window tree. The node-ID scheme is updated to prefix every stable ID with `w<windowIndex>:` so IDs remain unique across the merged output (`w0:42` for the main activity, `w1:7` for a popup menu). Per-iteration `try/finally` blocks recycle each `AccessibilityNodeInfo` as the walker descends — `.parent` and `.getChild(i)` both return fresh instances that leak if not recycled. A single-window fallback kicks in when `service.windows` is empty, which happens on the googlePlay flavor without `flagRetrieveInteractiveWindows` (the conservative accessibility config required by Play Store policy review).

**Pattern 3 — Three-tier `tapText` cascade (A9).** Rewrite `ActionExecutor.tapText`:
1. Find node by text across all windows (benefits from P1). If `node.isClickable` → `performAction(ACTION_CLICK)`. Return `ActionResult(ok=true, data="direct")`.
2. Otherwise walk up the parent chain, capped at 8 levels, looking for a clickable ancestor. Each `.parent` call returns a fresh node that must be recycled before the loop reassigns. If any ancestor is clickable → `performAction(ACTION_CLICK)` on it. Return `ActionResult(ok=true, data="parent")`.
3. Otherwise capture the original node's `getBoundsInScreen()` center *before* recycling, and fall back to coordinate `tap(cx, cy)` via the existing gesture path (which itself runs under `WakeLockManager.wakeForAction`). Return `ActionResult(ok=true, data="coords")`.

The `data` field tells the activity log and agent trace which tier succeeded, which is actually useful debugging info when a tap lands unexpectedly.

**Consequences:**

- **Wake-lock reliability:** closes the idle-screen silent-failure class of bugs for every gesture-dispatching tool, present and future. Adds minimum complexity per action (one `wakeForAction { ... }` wrapper call). The battery cost is tightly bounded by the 10s timeout and the PARTIAL lock level.
- **Multi-window visibility:** accessibility tree size grows modestly (typical overhead: 1–3 extra windows at ~20 nodes each — the notification shade and system UI). `MAX_NODES=512` cap in `ScreenReader` absorbs it. The node-ID prefix change is a breaking change to the ID format, but IDs are opaque and session-local — agents pass them back within a single turn, never persist them, so the breakage is invisible to callers.
- **tapText success rate:** validated against raulvidis's target-app matrix (Uber, Spotify, Instagram, Tinder, Maps, Settings). Direct-click path still wins on well-structured accessibility trees (Google Maps, Android Settings). Parent-walk catches the ~60% of cases where the clickable wrapper is within 1–2 levels of the text node. Coordinate fallback is the last-resort and backs ~10% of cases on the hardest apps.
- **`android_navigate` throughput:** Pattern 1 + Pattern 3 together eliminate the two biggest "tap fails for no obvious reason" failure modes inside the vision-driven navigate loop. Combined with A5 `android_screen_hash` as a cheap change-detection primitive (covered in the tool surface but not a pattern ADR), navigate iterations get faster and more reliable without changing the vision-model integration.
- **Test coverage:** Pattern 1 is tested implicitly via the existing `ActionExecutor` tests — the wake-lock wrap is transparent to the gesture completion path. Pattern 2 adds multi-window fixtures to `ScreenReader` tests where available; the single-window fallback path ensures the unit tests that use the old fixture shape still pass. Pattern 3 is hard to unit-test cleanly (accessibility node traversal is not easy to mock) so it's primarily verified via instrumentation tests on a real device.

**Alternatives rejected:**

- **`SCREEN_BRIGHT_WAKE_LOCK` instead of `PARTIAL_WAKE_LOCK`.** Deprecated since API 17. The agent doesn't need the screen visible — it just needs the input path warm. `PARTIAL_WAKE_LOCK` is the modern, non-deprecated choice.
- **Single-root with window enumeration as a fallback.** Leaks overlays when the overlay is the primary point of interaction (e.g. a full-screen dialog). Iterating all windows up-front is simpler and the overhead is bounded.
- **Only walk the parent chain, no coordinate fallback.** Fails on the ~10% of apps where nothing in the chain is clickable but the bounds are valid. Coordinate tap is the last-ditch option and is cheap to try.
- **Wake-lock the entire bridge command handler.** Over-broad — every `android_screen` call would grab the lock. Scope it to the gesture path only.

### 18. Unattended-access visibility: in-app banner vs. system-overlay chip (2026-04-17)

**Context:** v0.4.1's unattended-access mode (sideload-only) lets the agent wake the screen and dismiss the keyguard while the user is physically away from the phone. That's a meaningful expansion of agent authority — the user should have a prominent, always-on affordance telling them the mode is live so they can disable it at a glance. The existing v0.4.1 unattended work shipped the WindowManager `BridgeStatusOverlayChip` in an "amber Unattended ON" variant to cover this, but that surface only renders when the Hermes-Relay app is backgrounded (the floating chip is drawn via `SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW` and the user doesn't see their own app's overlay on top of itself). While the user is IN Hermes-Relay — on any tab — there was no always-on affordance at all; they had to scroll the Bridge tab down to the Unattended Access card to check status.

**Decision:** Ship two complementary affordances with distinct visibility windows, kept deliberately separate rather than trying to unify them.

1. **`UnattendedGlobalBanner`** (in-app) — Compose-drawn 28dp amber strip at the top of `RelayApp`'s scaffold, rendered unconditionally on every tab when `masterEnabled && unattendedEnabled && BuildFlavor.isSideload`. Theme-aware colours (amber-on-dark / dark-amber-on-pale-amber), pulsing dot, chevron → navigates to Bridge. Handles the **app-foregrounded** case.
2. **`BridgeStatusOverlayChip`** (existing) — WindowManager overlay via `SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW`, renders the amber "Unattended ON" variant when unattended is on. Forced visible whenever unattended is on, independent of the user's regular "show status overlay" preference. Handles the **app-backgrounded** case.

**Why split, not unified:**

- **OS constraint.** WindowManager overlays don't render on top of the owning app's UI in the foregrounded state — Android deliberately hides a package's own overlays when that package is itself foreground. One surface cannot cover both states.
- **Different visual budgets.** The in-app banner sits inside `RelayApp`'s scaffold and can occupy a full-width strip with text + chevron. The system chip is a floating pill with strict size limits (~180dp wide) to avoid obscuring content in the host app. Text copy differs accordingly.
- **Different z-order semantics.** The in-app banner composes with the rest of the app's UI and respects tab navigation. The system chip is user-positionable via drag and persists across app switches. Unifying them would force the weaker of the two behaviours onto the stronger surface.
- **Different dismissibility.** The in-app banner is non-dismissible and always renders when the preconditions are met (it's a fixed affordance, not a notification). The system chip is user-draggable but non-tap-dismissable while unattended is on. Both fail-closed.

**What the user sees (sideload only, unattended on):**

- On any Hermes-Relay tab → amber banner pinned to the top of the scaffold. Tap the chevron to jump to the Bridge tab and disable.
- App in the background (any other app foregrounded, or home screen) → floating amber "Unattended ON" chip in the system overlay. Tap to return to Hermes-Relay.

**Consequences:**

- **Correct coverage.** There is now no app-state window in which the user can miss that unattended mode is on.
- **Two places to maintain.** Copy changes need to ripple to both surfaces. Mitigated by keeping the strings short and similar but not identical (the in-app banner has more room and uses "agent can wake and drive this device"; the system chip uses the tighter "Unattended ON"). Both surfaces are driven by the same `unattendedEnabled` StateFlow, so state can't drift.
- **Theme story differs.** The in-app banner honours the Material 3 theme (light / dark / dynamic colour). The system chip uses a fixed amber for visibility on arbitrary host apps. This is a feature, not a defect — the system chip has no knowledge of the underlying app's theme and amber on amber would vanish.

**Alternatives rejected:**

- **One unified overlay chip, rendered even while the app is foregrounded.** Requires a custom always-foreground overlay mode via `TYPE_APPLICATION_OVERLAY` + manual z-order tricks; Android actively fights this on modern targets. Cost / benefit not worth it when a Compose-drawn banner solves the foreground case trivially.
- **Persistent foreground notification as the only affordance.** We already have one (`BridgeForegroundService`), and it's the authoritative in-sight kill switch. But (a) it lives in the shade until the user pulls it down and (b) it's for the master-toggle-on state, not for unattended specifically. A per-mode notification channel was considered and rejected as notification shade clutter.
- **In-app banner only, drop the system chip.** Regresses the backgrounded-app case. The system chip is the only surface that can tell the user at a glance that unattended is on while their phone is running a different app — exactly the case unattended is designed for.

### 19. Multi-Connection Support — one app, many Hermes servers (2026-04-18)

**2026-07-18 amendment:** ADR 38 replaces the endpoint-shaped identity described
below. A connection still represents one Hermes installation, but its stable ID
is independent of `apiServerUrl`; Dashboard/Gateway is the standard surface and
API/Relay endpoints are optional capabilities. The original model and migration
notes remain here as implementation history.

> **Terminology note (2026-04-18):** earlier drafts of this design called these "profiles" — that's been renamed to "Connection" to avoid collision with Hermes's in-config agent profiles concept (agent.profiles in config.yaml defines name + model + description for each agent personality). A follow-up pass will introduce the agent-profile layer on top of the connection layer described here.

**Decision:** Formalize the implicit single-server connection as a first-class `Connection` entity, with a `ConnectionStore` that holds N connections in DataStore and persists the active one. Switching connection is a heavy context swap: cancel in-flight SSE, disconnect relay WSS, rebuild `HermesApiClient`, update URL `StateFlow`s (which `RelayHttpClient`/`RelayVoiceClient` providers already re-read lazily), rebuild `AuthManager` against a connection-scoped `EncryptedSharedPreferences` file, reconnect, reprobe capabilities, reload sessions/personalities, restore per-connection last-active session.

**Why:**
- Users with multiple Hermes installs (home + work, dev + prod, multiple NAS hosts) want to switch targets without wiping pairing state or re-running onboarding.
- A "connection" in this app's terminology is *a separate gateway instance* — there is no `/api/connections` endpoint to enumerate. The honest model is "connection = baseUrl + bearer + pairing record". This also matches how Discord achieves multi-agent-in-one-channel: each "agent" is a distinct bot backed by its own gateway.
- Personalities (Decision 8) are orthogonal and remain per-connection — each server exposes its own personality map via `/api/config`.

**How:**
- **Connection model:** UUID id, editable label (default = hostname), `apiServerUrl`, `relayUrl`, `tokenStoreKey` (EncryptedSharedPreferences file name), `pairedAt`, `lastActiveSessionId`, `transportHint`, `expiresAt`. Serialized as a JSON array in DataStore key `connections_v1`; active connection in `active_connection_id`.
- **Migration:** on first launch of the new version, `ConnectionStore.migrateLegacyConnectionIfNeeded()` seeds connection 0 with the existing `hermes_companion_auth_hw` file as its store — zero re-pair, zero token migration, fully transparent to the user. Additionally, the DataStore key rename (`profiles_v1` → `connections_v1`, `active_profile_id` → `active_connection_id`) migrates in-place on first launch after the rename pass.
- **Auth layer:** `SessionTokenStore.tryCreate()` accepts a `prefsName` parameter; `AuthManager` gains a `connectionId` constructor parameter and picks the store file via `Connection.buildTokenStoreKey(id)`. `CertPinStore` is unchanged — pins are already keyed by `host:port` and correctly shared across connections targeting the same server.
- **Network rebind:** `RelayHttpClient` and `RelayVoiceClient` take provider lambdas that read URL + token at call time, so updating the backing `MutableStateFlow`s is sufficient — no client recreation. `HermesApiClient` is recreated (private OkHttp pool + SSE factory), using the existing `rebuildApiClient()` path in `ConnectionViewModel`.
- **UI:** top-bar connection chip → `ConnectionSwitcherSheet` bottom sheet with radio list + "Manage connections…" link. `Screen.ConnectionsSettings` hosts card CRUD: rename (inline), re-pair (reuses `ConnectionWizard` with `connectionId` nav arg), revoke, remove.
- **Remove semantics:** `ConnectionStore.removeConnection()` calls `context.deleteSharedPreferences(tokenStoreKey)` to wipe the connection's auth material. Cert pin survives in the global TOFU map keyed by host:port so re-adding the same server is still trusted.

**Scope — what's per-connection vs. global:**

| Per-connection | Global |
|---|---|
| API baseUrl + bearer | Theme, dev-mode toggles |
| Sessions, messages, search | Bridge safety vocabulary (blocklist, destructive verbs, timer duration) |
| Bridge capability policy (ADR 63) | Status-overlay presentation |
| Personalities (`/api/config`) | Feature flags / DataStore overrides |
| Skills, memory | Notification companion enabled/disabled |
| Relay WSS endpoint + cert pin (shared by host) | Keystore itself (one keystore, many entries) |
| Voice transcribe/synthesize endpoint | |
| Bridge command target | |
| Last-active session ID | |

**Amended by ADR 63 — Bridge capability grants are per-connection.** The
blocklist, destructive vocabulary, confirmation timeout, and timed-window
duration remain phone-wide safety preferences. Actual Always/Never/Timed
authority is keyed by Connection ID, so server A cannot inherit grants made for
server B.

**Trade-off — "both agents in one channel" (Discord-style) deferred:** a unified chat view showing interleaved messages from two connections is possible but semantically fraught: sessions, memory, and tool calls don't merge on the server side, so the unified view would be purely client-side theater. Deferred until there's a concrete use case; v1 users switch contexts with one tap and carry on.

**Upstream opportunity:** a real `/api/profiles` endpoint that returns `[{id, name, endpoint, model}]` from a single config would let one hermes install expose multiple agent profiles without the user running multiple daemons. That's the upcoming Pass 2 work on top of this connection layer — note that upstream's concept ("agent profile") is different from the multi-server concept this decision records ("connection"). Filed alongside `/api/commands` as a future contribution in `docs/upstream-contributions.md`.

### 20. Dashboard plugin: single plugin with internal tabs + pre-built IIFE bundle (2026-04-18)

**Context:** The upstream Dashboard Plugin System landed on hermes-agent's `axiom` branch in three commits (`01214a7f` plugin system, `3f6c4346` theme, `247929b0` OAuth providers). The gateway now scans `~/.hermes/plugins/<name>/dashboard/manifest.json` at startup and exposes registered plugins as tabs in the web UI, with a frontend SDK exposed at `window.__HERMES_PLUGIN_SDK__` (React + shadcn subset + hooks) and a plugin-registration global at `window.__HERMES_PLUGINS__.register(name, Component)`. Several deferred items from the MVP audit (cron manager, skills browser, memory viewer) previously blocked on "needs relay extension" flip with this system — most belong in the upstream dashboard directly. The relay plugin only needs to surface the four items that **only the relay knows about**: paired-device state, bridge command history, push delivery (future), and active `MediaRegistry` tokens. The question was how to ship those four surfaces cleanly.

**Decision:** Ship one plugin at `plugin/dashboard/` exposing a single tab `/relay` that hosts four internal sub-tabs (Relay Management, Bridge Activity, Push Console, Media Inspector), with the frontend authored in JSX under `src/`, bundled to a committed IIFE at `dist/index.js` via esbuild, and a thin FastAPI proxy at `plugin_api.py` forwarding to loopback-only relay HTTP routes.

Four sub-decisions captured together:

1. **Single plugin with internal `Tabs`, not four plugins.** The upstream manifest allows exactly one `tab.path` per plugin. Four plugins would fragment the dashboard nav (four "Relay — …" entries between Skills and whatever comes next), confuse operators ("where's paired-device state?"), and multiply the manifest / rescan surface for no UX gain. One plugin at `/relay` with an internal shadcn `Tabs` component keeps relay concerns grouped and gives us a single header (Auto-refresh toggle, health pill, version string) across all four sub-surfaces.

2. **Pre-built IIFE bundle, committed to git.** The upstream example plugin (`plugins/example-dashboard/dashboard/`) uses plain `React.createElement` with no build step. That's readable for a one-tab proof of concept; for four non-trivial tabs with shared `lib/` helpers (sentence formatters, relative-time, byte-size, API wrappers) it's actively painful to maintain. Decision: author JSX under `plugin/dashboard/src/`, bundle with `esbuild` (target `es2020`, format `iife`, React coming from the SDK global — NOT bundled), minify, and commit the ~16 KB `dist/index.js` alongside the source. Operators who `git pull` get a ready-to-serve bundle; the dashboard `<script src>` loads it verbatim and never runs a build. `esbuild` is the only dev dep, listed in `plugin/dashboard/package.json`.

3. **Loopback-only for the three new relay routes.** `/bridge/activity`, `/media/inspect`, `/relay/info` are gated with the same `_require_loopback()` helper pattern as `/bridge/status`, `/pairing/register`, and `/media/register` — any `request.remote` other than `127.0.0.1` / `::1` gets HTTP 403. The plugin backend runs inside the gateway process (itself bound to localhost) and calls the relay at `http://127.0.0.1:{HERMES_RELAY_PORT}/...` — no bearer minting, no new credentials, no new attack surface. We also added a loopback-exempt branch to the existing bearer-gated `/sessions` handler so the plugin can list paired devices without the relay needing to hand itself a token. Media paths are sanitized (basename-only) at the `MediaRegistry.list_all()` layer so a future decision to expose these routes externally wouldn't leak filesystem layout.

   **2026-07-12 amendment:** `/relay/info` now has a second, paired-device
   bearer-authenticated path for Android Diagnostics. The loopback dashboard
   path is unchanged. The remote response is the same sanitized contract and
   contains no tokens, secrets, config contents, or filesystem paths;
   `/bridge/activity` and `/media/inspect` remain loopback-only.

4. **Dashboard backend is a thin proxy; relay is source of truth.** `plugin_api.py` exposes five routes at `/api/plugins/hermes-relay/{overview,sessions,bridge-activity,media,push}` and forwards to the relay over `httpx.AsyncClient` with a 5-second timeout. It does not cache or retry. Relay connect-error / timeout / 5xx translate to `HTTPException(502, detail=…)` carrying the relay address, so the UI can render a "relay unreachable at 127.0.0.1:8767" banner; 4xx passes through verbatim. The `/push` route is a static stub until FCM is wired.

   **2026-08-21 amendment:** the authenticated `/provider-usage` route is a
   deliberate process-local exception. The Dashboard process owns the live
   Gateway session, so this Relay-plugin route resolves its active credential
   on demand and feeds the same provider-neutral Relay adapter without waiting
   for another turn. It stores no provider secret or additional Dashboard state.

**Consequences:**

- **Zero upstream dependency.** We ship against the already-published `axiom` plugin-system contract (scanner + manifest shape + SDK globals) without needing to patch hermes-agent. If upstream changes the icon whitelist or the SDK surface, we adjust the manifest / `src/` and rebuild — no relay changes.
- **Installer already covers discovery.** `install.sh` step 3 symlinks `~/.hermes/plugins/hermes-relay` → `<repo>/plugin`, so `~/.hermes/plugins/hermes-relay/dashboard/manifest.json` resolves automatically on any host that's already installed us. No new installer step; the plugin is live after the next `hermes-gateway` restart.
- **One extra dev dep (`esbuild`).** Listed in `plugin/dashboard/package.json` under `devDependencies`. Not a runtime dep — the gateway never runs `npm install`. Developers who want to modify the frontend run `cd plugin/dashboard && npm install && npm run build`, which regenerates `dist/index.js`; CI doesn't run the build because the committed bundle is the shipped artifact.
- **Committed build artifact policy.** `dist/index.js` is committed to git alongside the source. Unusual — most projects would `.gitignore` it — but required here because the dashboard scans live filesystem paths and has no build step of its own. The esbuild output is deterministic given the same source + minify flags, so PR review can diff the source without fighting the bundle; operators treat the bundle as read-only.
- **Loopback-branch divergence on `/sessions`.** The bearer-gated `/sessions` path still returns `is_current: bool` (true for the caller's own bearer); the loopback branch returns the same session rows without `is_current` (no caller context). Documented in `docs/relay-server.md` and in the handler's docstring so future maintainers don't lose the divergence.
- **Push Console UX before FCM.** The stub tab renders an "FCM not configured" banner + link to the deferred-items doc, which is honest but does occupy a nav slot for a non-working feature. Accepted trade-off: the alternative is shipping three tabs now and a four-tab reshuffle later, which churns muscle memory and breaks any `localStorage` tab-selection persistence.

**Alternatives rejected:**

- **Four separate plugins** (one per sub-tab). Rejected — fragments nav, multiplies manifest surface, no UX win.
- **No build step; plain `React.createElement` in `dist/index.js` directly.** Readable for one tab; actively hostile for four tabs + shared helpers. Source unreviewable once it hits ~500 LOC.
- **Bundle React into the IIFE.** Would bloat the bundle from ~16 KB to ~150 KB and introduce React-version drift risk vs. the dashboard shell's React. Using the SDK's `window.__HERMES_PLUGIN_SDK__.React` keeps us pinned to whatever the dashboard ships.
- **Plugin mints its own "dashboard key" bearer via a new relay config field.** Would work but adds a new credential to manage (rotation, storage, revocation) for no security benefit over the existing loopback gate — both layers already require localhost access.
- **Skills browser / cron manager / memory viewer as relay-plugin tabs.** Rejected — these belong in upstream dashboard plugins, not a relay plugin. The relay has no unique visibility into them; upstream knows everything we'd know.
- **Hot-reload the Python `plugin_api.py` without a gateway restart.** Upstream supports hot-reload for the frontend bundle (`POST /api/dashboard/plugins/rescan`) but Python modules still need a full gateway restart. Accepted — the backend is a thin proxy that rarely changes.

### 21. Agent Profile picker — Hermes profile API routing with overlay fallback (2026-04-18, updated 2026-05-18)

**Decision:** The relay auto-discovers upstream Hermes profiles by scanning `~/.hermes/profiles/*/` (plus a synthetic "default" entry for the root `~/.hermes/config.yaml`). Each discovered profile is advertised in the `auth.ok` payload as `{name, model, description, system_message, api_server_*}`. When a selected profile advertises `api_server_url`, Android routes chat/session API traffic to that profile's Hermes API server so memory, sessions, tools, `.env`, and model config follow upstream Hermes isolation. When no isolated API route is advertised, Android falls back to the older compatibility overlay: send the selected profile's `model` and `SOUL.md` (`system_message`) on the active Connection's API server.

**Why this supersedes the original §21 design:**

The first pass read from a fictional top-level `profiles:` / `agents:` list in `~/.hermes/config.yaml`. Upstream Hermes has **never** used that schema — profiles upstream are isolated directory instances at `~/.hermes/profiles/<name>/`, each with its own `config.yaml`, `.env`, `SOUL.md`, memory, sessions, skills, and (optionally) its own gateway daemon. The old path always returned an empty list on real installs, which is why nothing ever populated in the picker.

Rather than invent our own schema, match upstream's layout. The relay scans the directory, reads each profile's config.yaml + SOUL.md, and reports what's really there.

**Three-layer model (unchanged at the UI level):**
- **Connection** (§19) — which Hermes server + gateway. One scan per server.
- **Profile** (this decision) — which upstream-layout agent directory on that server. Routes to that profile's API server when advertised; otherwise overlays model + SOUL as fallback.
- **Personality** (§8) — which system-prompt preset *within* the agent's config.

**How:**

Server side (`plugin/relay/config.py`, `plugin/relay/server.py`):
- `_load_profiles` rewritten to walk `~/.hermes/profiles/*/`. For each profile: `name = dir.name`; `model = config.yaml/model.default || "unknown"`; `description = config.yaml/description || first non-blank line of SOUL.md || ""`; `system_message = SOUL.md content || null`. Plus a synthetic `"default"` entry from the root config.
- `_load_profiles` also reads profile-local API server metadata from `config.yaml` (`platforms.api_server` / `api_server`) and `.env` (`API_SERVER_ENABLED`, `API_SERVER_HOST`, `API_SERVER_PORT`, `API_SERVER_KEY`). It advertises `api_server_enabled`, `api_server_url`, `api_server_host`, `api_server_port`, and `api_server_key_present`, but never the API key value. Local bind hosts (`127.0.0.1`, `localhost`, `0.0.0.0`, `::1`) are rewritten through `RelayConfig.webapi_url`; operators should set `RELAY_WEBAPI_URL` to the phone-reachable base API URL. Android also rewrites loopback profile URLs against the active Connection API URL as a defensive fallback for stale or host-local payloads.
- New `RelayConfig.profile_discovery_enabled: bool = True`. Set to `false` in the relay's config to skip the scan and advertise an empty list — matches our configurability pattern of "opt-out defaults" for discovery features. Disabled state is logged at INFO on startup.
- `auth.ok` payload shape: each entry is `{"name": str, "model": str, "description": str, "system_message": str | null, "api_server_enabled": bool, "api_server_url": str | null, "api_server_host": str | null, "api_server_port": int | null, "api_server_key_present": bool}` (snake_case on the wire).

Client side (`app/src/main/kotlin/.../data/ProfileData.kt`, `auth/AuthManager.kt`, `viewmodel/ChatViewModel.kt`):
- `Profile` includes the `apiServer*` metadata and exposes `hasIsolatedApi`.
- `AuthManager.parseAgentProfiles` reads the new `api_server_*` fields with safe defaults so older relays remain compatible.
- `ConnectionViewModel` keeps a base API client for server health/settings and a chat-routed API client for actual chat. Selecting a profile with `apiServerUrl` swaps chat/session calls to that profile API URL using the Connection's stored API bearer token.
- **Multiplex routing (2026-07-19, amended 2026-07-28).** When dashboard `/api/status` positively reports `gateway_mode=multiplex` and the selected non-default profile appears in its `profiles` list, the chat-routed API client uses the shared listener at `/p/<encoded-profile>`. Dedicated `api_server_url` metadata still wins. Missing/older topology and the server-default selection stay on the root API URL, so no prefix is guessed. A known multiplex profile route uses a separately encrypted per-Connection/per-profile API key configured in the profile sheet; if none exists, Android sends no bearer rather than reusing the root Connection key. The optional compatibility bootstrap recognizes the prefix for slash-command route matching only; upstream middleware remains responsible for authorization and profile runtime scope.
- `ChatViewModel` send path omits `profile`, `model`, and profile `SOUL.md` overrides when the selected profile has an isolated API route. The profile API server owns its own default model, SOUL, sessions, memory, tools, and `.env`; Android still appends phone context when enabled. If no isolated API route exists, it keeps the compatibility overlay behavior.
- Chat session browsing is scoped to the selected profile route. On profile switch Android clears the old session list, refetches through the routed API client, and labels the drawer with the active profile/API fallback.
- Gateway session creation, resume, and recovery for a named profile require the authoritative result's `info.profile_name` to match the requested profile. A missing or different owner fails closed before a prompt is submitted; this prevents an older gateway that ignored `params.profile`, or a profile removed after discovery, from being treated as the selected agent. The launch/default path remains compatible with older results because it does not claim a named profile.
- The Gateway-native inspector tracks `profiles.describe` and `profiles.configure` as separate capabilities. A host may remain a valid read source after a configure method-not-found response; Android retains pending drafts, stops offering Gateway-owned writes for that inspector, and keeps Relay-owned memory plus the older all-Relay fallback unchanged.
- Voice requests carry the selected profile to both upstream dashboard audio routes and relay-owned `/voice/*` routes. Standard `/api/audio/transcribe`, `/api/audio/speak`, `/api/audio/speak-stream`, and provider-catalog requests use the selected profile query; Relay `/voice/config` resolves profile-local `tts`/`stt` where present, while `/voice/output/*` and `/voice/realtime/*` resolve experimental `voice_output` / `realtime_voice` sections from the selected profile config and fall back to relay defaults with explicit `config_scope` metadata.

**Trade-offs / v1 scope:**
- **Isolation when the profile API is running; overlay only as fallback.** Proper Hermes profile switching requires each profile's API server/gateway to be running and discoverable. If a profile has no API route, the app can still provide the older model/SOUL overlay, but that does not isolate memory, sessions, tools, provider auth, or cron jobs.
- **Credential isolation.** The relay exposes only `api_server_key_present`, never the key. Dedicated profile API origins retain the Connection credential contract. Shared `/p/<profile>` routes use encrypted profile credentials and never inherit the root key.
- **SOUL.md size.** Some SOUL files are multi-KB (Mizu's is 8 KB). The full content ships as `system_message` only in overlay fallback mode; isolated profile APIs should rely on their own configured SOUL/default prompt.
- **Persisted per Connection.** The selected profile name and last session id are persisted per Connection/profile context. Switching Connections clears the in-memory object, then rehydrates the destination Connection's persisted profile once its advertised profile list arrives.
- **Voice is profile-aware but still relay-mediated.** Voice output/realtime settings can follow the selected profile, but provider secrets stay server-side and the Hermes chat/tool loop still owns the final assistant text. Bridge commands remain unrelated to model choice.
- **Config toggle.** `profile_discovery_enabled = false` lets a server op keep the phone picker empty (e.g. if the operator wants Connections-only semantics). Per our configurability pattern of "enable useful defaults, let the operator opt out."

**Earlier (abandoned) design, for the record:**

First attempt parsed a top-level `profiles:` / `agents:` list from one YAML. That schema does not exist upstream and always returned empty on real installs. The data class + picker + `modelOverride` wiring from that attempt are preserved; only the data source + the addition of `system_message` changed. See commits `0303a4f` (initial parse), `b9d2914` (build fix), and the R1/R2 pass that followed this decision rewrite.

### 22. Profile-scoped read-only config + skills API (2026-04-18)

**Decision:** Add two relay-native HTTP routes — `GET /api/profiles/{name}/config` and `GET /api/profiles/{name}/skills` — that read `<profile_home>/config.yaml` and walk `<profile_home>/skills/<category>/<name>/SKILL.md` respectively. Both are read-only, use the existing loopback-or-bearer auth pattern (matching `/notifications/recent`), and resolve `name` via the same `default → ~/.hermes` / otherwise → `~/.hermes/profiles/<name>` helper used by `_load_profiles`. For `PUT /api/skills/toggle` (the upstream toggle shape the phone's capability probe checks), the bootstrap registers a stubbed handler that always returns **501 Not Implemented** with a structured `{"error": "skill_toggle_not_implemented", ...}` body.

**Why relay-native, not a dashboard proxy:**

The hermes-agent dashboard exposes `/api/config` and `/api/skills` via `hermes_cli/web_server.py` — a separate loopback-only web server from the chat API at `:8642`. Two problems if we proxied through the dashboard:
1. **No profile scoping.** The dashboard's `/api/config` operates on the active profile only; there's no way to read another profile's config without switching first. Our relay already has the layout knowledge (`_load_profiles` scans the tree); duplicating that as "switch profile, read, switch back" is fragile and racy.
2. **Secrets leakage risk.** Credentials normally live in `~/.hermes/.env` or `~/.hermes/auth.json`, but Hermes also supports some credentials in `config.yaml` and extensions may add their own sensitive fields. A purpose-built read route therefore keeps the remote shape explicit: paired remote clients receive only `description` and `model.default`, while loopback operator callers can inspect the complete parsed file. The response remains `{profile, path, config, readonly: true}`, with `path: "config.yaml"` remotely so host layout is not disclosed.

Both endpoints trust the same boundary as every other phone-facing relay route: bearer-auth for remote callers, loopback for in-process dashboard proxy calls. The config endpoint additionally enforces an explicit remote response schema rather than key-name redaction, so new or nested extension sections cannot silently become public. `.env` and `auth.json` are **never** read or returned by these routes.

**Why read-only in v0.7:**

Write support would require an `active_profile` routing layer on the relay — picking which profile's config to mutate, flushing caches, notifying any running gateway daemon for that profile. hermes-desktop handles this by shelling out to `hermes profile use <name>` + `hermes config set ...`, which bakes the lifecycle into the CLI. Doing the equivalent from the relay means either (a) shelling out (new subprocess surface, env handling, error classification) or (b) reimplementing the write path in Python (duplicates upstream logic, risks drift). Neither belongs in this pass. The `readonly: true` field in the response is a deliberate contract — callers that probe it can hide edit UI cleanly when (eventually) a v0.8 server drops the flag.

**Why 501 on `PUT /api/skills/toggle` instead of omitting the route:**

`tools.skills_tool` (the upstream module the bootstrap already imports for `skills_list` / `skill_view`) has no clean enable/disable hook — that logic lives on `hermes_cli.web_server.py`, which the relay doesn't proxy. Three options:
1. Don't register the route → 404 → Android capability probe can't tell "toggle not implemented" from "wrong URL / server too old."
2. Register with full behavior → requires either shelling to the CLI or duplicating upstream persistence. Same objections as write-path above, worse because skill toggle state is per-profile and upstream persists it in a JSON sidecar whose shape we don't want to pin.
3. Register a 501 stub with a stable structured body → capability probe sees the route, reads `error: "skill_toggle_not_implemented"`, renders the toggle UI as disabled with a tooltip. Client logic stays a simple switch on error code; no magic version sniffing.

We pick (3). When a focused upstream follow-up exposes a real toggle on `api_server.py`, we flip the stub to call through — the Kotlin client sees the 501 disappear and the toggle unlocks.

**Trade-offs:**
- **Profile scoping is a directory lookup, not an active-profile check.** The request says "read profile X"; we do not require X to be the currently-active profile for the dashboard or for any gateway daemon. This matches the read-only intent — the phone picker shows every profile's shape, even ones no gateway is running against.
- **Skill `enabled: true` is hardcoded.** We don't track disabled state server-side yet; the field is part of the response only so the shape aligns with upstream's eventual toggle response. Keep it stable so the Kotlin model doesn't need reshuffling when toggles land.
- **No pagination on skills.** A profile with thousands of skills would get a fat response, but that's well outside current usage (the populous profiles on our server carry 20-40 skills). Revisit if this stops being true.
- **Path-traversal guard is light.** Profile name is rejected if it contains `/`, `\\`, `.`, or `..`. That's enough for the `profiles/<name>/` join we do, and matches how `_load_profiles` already trusts `iterdir()` results — names that arrive over the wire get the extra check.

**Why not just surface `_load_profiles`'s new `gateway_running` / `has_soul` / `skill_count` everywhere?**

Those fields (added in the same commit series — see `auth.ok` profile shape) are intentionally summary-only. The picker uses them to render status; the detail screen pulls the full config + skill list via the new endpoints. Splitting summary (cheap, piggybacks on existing `auth.ok`) from detail (expensive enough to warrant on-demand HTTP) keeps pairing snappy even for servers with many skills per profile.

**Scope addendum (2026-04-18):** Followed up with two more profile-scoped read routes — `GET /api/profiles/{name}/soul` and `GET /api/profiles/{name}/memory` — to feed the phone Profile Inspector's four-section layout (config / SOUL / memory / skills). Both reuse `_resolve_profile_home`, the loopback-or-bearer gate, and the `profile_not_found` 404 shape from the original two endpoints. Content is capped inline at **200KB for SOUL.md** and **50KB per memory file**; larger bodies flag `truncated: true` and clients see the on-disk `size_bytes` so they know real dimensions without fetching the full body. The caps exist because the Inspector is a viewer, not a diff or edit tool — phone-safe wire sizes matter more than lossless fidelity, and anyone who needs a full dump has the dashboard. Memory listing is intentionally non-recursive (one `iterdir` pass, no `rglob`) so subdirectories under `memories/` — used by some users for archival snapshots — don't spam the response. `MEMORY.md` and `USER.md` (per upstream `hermes_cli/profiles.py`) sort first; the rest are alphabetical, so the ordering is stable across filesystems. Absent SOUL.md returns 200 with `exists: false`; absent `memories/` returns 200 with an empty `entries` array — both let the Inspector render the section rather than mask "no content yet" as a transport failure.

**Scope addendum (2026-07-15):** Added `GET /api/profiles/{name}/avatar`
for an explicit user action that imports an agent badge image from the Hermes
host. Discovery is deliberately shallow and deterministic: direct-child files
with conventional `avatar`/`profile` names win, followed by compatible aliases,
across PNG, JPEG, WebP, and GIF. The resolved path must stay inside the profile
home after symlink resolution and satisfy the Relay media-size cap. Android then
copies the bytes into its existing connection-and-profile-scoped icon store.
This keeps the host filesystem read behind Relay pairing and avoids coupling the
vanilla upstream chat path or live UI rendering to host availability.

## Voice Mode — Architecture

**Context:** We wanted real-time voice conversation with the Hermes agent — user speaks, agent listens, agent speaks back, orb reacts. Hermes-agent has six TTS providers and five STT providers fully implemented in `tools/tts_tool.py` and `tools/transcription_tools.py`, plus a CLI `voice_mode.py` that uses them for push-to-talk. At the time, core did not expose those functions through the API server. Upstream PR [#8199](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/pull/8199) is now the canonical path for native `/v1/audio/transcriptions` and `/v1/audio/speech`; Relay should treat that as the long-term execution surface while keeping `/voice/*` as the paired mobile facade.

**The four decisions:**

### 1. Voice endpoints live on the relay, not upstream hermes-agent

Three options were considered:

1. **Patch upstream `gateway/platforms/api_server.py`** — add native audio routes directly. The current canonical shape is PR #8199's OpenAI-style `/v1/audio/transcriptions` and `/v1/audio/speech`, not a competing `/api/audio/*` or core `/voice/*` route family.
2. **Relay plugin hosts the endpoints** — `plugin/relay/voice.py` imports `tools.tts_tool.text_to_speech_tool` and `tools.transcription_tools.transcribe_audio` directly from the hermes-agent venv (where the relay is editable-installed) and wraps them in async handlers. Chosen.
3. **Phone calls provider APIs directly** — ElevenLabs / OpenAI / Groq SDKs on Android. Rejected: would require API keys stored on the phone, different providers per-device, no unified config, and the phone would need to replicate the provider-selection logic that `tts_tool.py` / `transcription_tools.py` already implement.

**Why (2):**
- The relay already runs inside the hermes-agent venv (editable install per `install.sh` — `pip show hermes-relay` confirms). `from tools.tts_tool import text_to_speech_tool` just works.
- Provider config (`tts:` and `stt:` sections) is already in `~/.hermes/config.yaml` — the tools read it internally. The phone gets whatever provider the operator configured on the server, with zero per-device keys.
- No upstream dependency. Ships as part of hermes-relay; updates via `git pull` in the plugin clone.
- If upstream native `/v1/audio/*` endpoints are present, the relay can switch `/voice/transcribe` and `/voice/synthesize` to proxy those endpoints before falling back to private helper imports, without phone changes.

**Trade-offs accepted:**
- Uses private upstream helpers (`_load_tts_config`, `_load_stt_config`) for the `/voice/config` endpoint because they're the cleanest way to report what's configured. Marked clearly as private/unstable in the handler — if upstream refactors these, our `/voice/config` response shape is the only thing that needs a patch.
- Voice endpoints fail with 503 on servers where the hermes-agent venv doesn't have the providers' optional deps installed. Documented — operator's responsibility to run `pip install "hermes-relay[voice]"` or the equivalent.

### 2. Buffer-not-stream TTS responses (sentence-level client chunking)

The plan initially suggested streaming audio/opus over chunked HTTP — sentence-by-sentence during agent streaming. Two problems:

- `text_to_speech_tool` is **sync** and returns a file **path**, not a chunked byte generator. Streaming output would require rewriting the function or calling provider SDKs directly (MiniMax/ElevenLabs both support streaming, Edge TTS doesn't, NeuTTS doesn't).
- Android `MediaPlayer` prefers complete files — chunked Opus works but requires AudioTrack + manual Opus decode, which is a different layer of complexity.

**Decision:** The relay returns whole `.mp3` files per request. The client does sentence-boundary detection on the SSE chat stream (`VoiceViewModel.startStreamObserver` diffs `messages: StateFlow`), extracts complete sentences as they arrive, POSTs each sentence to `/voice/synthesize`, queues the resulting mp3 file into a `Channel<String>`, and a consumer coroutine plays them one after another with `awaitCompletion` between. First audio plays within one sentence of the agent starting to respond — effectively the same UX as true streaming.

**Why:**
- Zero upstream changes required.
- Works across all six TTS providers uniformly (not just the 3 with streaming SDKs).
- `MediaPlayer` handles mp3 natively — no AudioTrack + decoder ceremony.
- Bad sentences (failed TTS) don't corrupt the stream — the queue just skips.

**Trade-off:** If the agent response is one giant sentence, latency is dominated by that sentence's synthesis time. In practice responses have frequent punctuation so this is a non-issue.

### 3. `.m4a` (MPEG-4/AAC), not `.webm`, for recorder output

The plan suggested WebM/Opus from `MediaRecorder` (API 29+). Rejected:

- WebM support in Android's `MediaRecorder` arrived in API 29 but encoder availability is vendor-dependent on older builds. AAC in MPEG-4 is guaranteed since API 18 and universally supported.
- OpenAI's `whisper-1` and Groq's `whisper-large-v3-turbo` both accept `.m4a` / `.mp4` via the upstream `_validate_audio_file` path in `transcribe_audio`.
- Faster-whisper (local STT default) transparently handles m4a via ffmpeg.
- M4a at 16kHz/64kbps mono is ~8KB/second — small enough for LAN upload, indistinguishable from Opus at that sample rate.

Use `.m4a`.

### 4. ChatViewModel integration via observation, not callbacks

The plan called for adding a `// VOICE HOOK` callback to `ChatViewModel` so `VoiceViewModel` could see streaming deltas in real time and feed them to the sentence-detection buffer.

**Rejected.** Instead `VoiceViewModel.startStreamObserver` collects `chatVm.messages: StateFlow<List<ChatMessage>>` (already public on `ChatHandler`) and diffs the last assistant message's content length on each emission to extract streaming deltas. Zero changes to `ChatViewModel` or `ChatHandler`.

**Why:**
- Keeps chat code decoupled from voice. If voice mode is ripped out tomorrow, `ChatViewModel` is untouched.
- Observes the same state the chat UI observes — no divergence risk.
- Transcribed user text routes through the existing `chatVm.sendMessage(text)` path, so voice utterances appear as normal user messages in chat history. Load the session on another device and you see the transcript.

**Follow-up (2026-07-25):** the observer no longer relies on a single
`isStreaming=true` assistant message. A per-turn cursor follows every new
assistant bubble until the run-level `ChatViewModel.isStreaming` state ends,
so tool handoffs and the final answer are narrated in order. The cursor fences
the pre-turn stable UI identities and submitted user-turn/session identity,
and only speaks strict content suffix growth, preventing StateFlow/history
reconciliation or a pending-new-chat session switch from replaying old or
rewritten text. Each newly observed assistant bubble also inserts a speech
boundary, so an interim fragment without punctuation cannot run into the final
answer.

### Alternatives explicitly rejected

- **Android `SpeechRecognizer`** (on-device Google speech recognition) for STT — would bypass the relay entirely and lose the "server provider" consistency. Also Google-Play-Services-dependent, which contradicts the "works on degoogled Android" goal.
- **In-app TTS** (`android.speech.tts.TextToSpeech`) — same problem, plus vastly inferior voice quality compared to ElevenLabs / OpenAI. No synergy with the server's provider config.
- **Dedicated voice WebSocket channel on the relay** alongside chat/terminal/bridge — heavier than REST for a request-response modality with no true bidirectional streaming needs. REST + SSE (via the existing chat path) is sufficient.
- **Sphere `voiceMode` expansion to 1.0×** (plan target) — physically impossible with current `baseRadius`/data-ring geometry. Capped at 1.08×, which is still perceptually "bigger" and preserves the data ring's orbit math. Documented in the MorphingSphere KDoc.

### 23. Branch policy: `main` + `dev` (2026-04-19)

**Evolution of the earlier "Feature branches" policy (2026-04-13):** the
original rule was "feature branches merge into `main` continuously, `main`
is always shippable." That worked while the project was small but produced
two operational frictions as it grew:

1. **Staging had no home.** The server pulled `main` for dogfood, so any
   feature that passed CI was immediately exercised against real pairing /
   bridge / voice state. When a merged-but-rough feature hit a bug on the
   server, rolling back meant reverting a merge commit on the shippable
   branch, which fought the "main is always shippable" invariant.
2. **Release cadence and merge cadence were entangled.** Cutting a release
   meant version-bumping on `main`, which required a branch-protection
   carve-out (`release: vX.Y.Z` direct pushes) because atomic bump + tag
   couldn't round-trip through a PR without racing another merge.

**New policy:**
- `main` = **released state only**. Every commit corresponds to a tag or
  a release-merge from `dev`.
- `dev` = **integration branch**. Feature branches target `dev`; the
  `[Unreleased]` CHANGELOG section lives there.
- `origin/dev` is the single integration authority. Local `dev` is a
  fast-forward-only mirror; concurrent work stays on task worktrees, and any
  multi-branch batch uses a named integration branch plus PR rather than a
  private local-`dev` queue.
- Server pulls `dev` for staging. Users and `hermes-relay-update` track
  `main` and tags.
- Releases are opened as PRs from `dev` into `main`, merged `--no-ff`,
  then tagged from `main`. No direct-push carve-out is needed — the
  release PR is just a normal PR.

**Trade-offs accepted:**
- **Hotfix sync step.** When a hotfix lands on `main` from a tag
  (bypassing `dev`), you have to merge `main` back into `dev` so the next
  release doesn't collide on `appVersionCode`. Documented in RELEASE.md
  hotfix recipe.
- **Two branches to keep up to date.** Feature-branch authors need to
  remember that the base is `dev`, not `main`. Mitigated by branch
  protection on both and by CI running on both.
- **Server tracks pre-release state.** Post-policy the server pulls
  `dev`, so the real shift is that the Play Store / sideload-update
  audience now trails `dev` by a release cadence, not a merge cadence.

**CI impact:** the same workflow files trigger on both branches via
path-filtered triggers (`ci-android.yml` / `ci-plugin.yml` after the
2026-04-19 split). `docs.yml` stays `main`-only — docs publish represents
shipped state, not integration state. Surface release workflows are tag-triggered and
branch-agnostic, unchanged.

### 24. Multi-endpoint pairing payload + network-aware switching (2026-04-19)

**Problem:** pairing QRs today carry a single `host:port` (API) plus a single
`relay.url`. That works for LAN-only operators, but the moment the phone
moves between LAN / Tailscale / a public reverse-proxy hostname, the
single URL is wrong half the time. Upstream hermes-agent's stance
(SECURITY.md) is "use VPN / Tailscale / firewall or don't expose" — they
don't plan to own a remote-access story. We do.

**Decision:** Extend the QR schema with an **optional ordered list of
endpoint candidates**. The phone picks the highest-priority reachable
candidate at connect time and re-evaluates on network change. Old
single-endpoint QRs remain valid — the phone synthesizes a single
priority-0 candidate from the top-level fields when `endpoints` is absent.
Supported candidates probe speculatively in parallel, but results are consumed
in strict priority order: a lower-priority route can never displace a reachable
higher-priority route, while dead priorities add one bounded probe window total
instead of one full timeout each. Experimental transports start only after all
supported candidates fail.

**Semantics (locked):**
- **Generated defaults are secure-first (amended 2026-08-12).** An available
  pinned Hermes Secure Link, Tailscale Serve, and configured public TLS candidates
  precede plain LAN. LAN remains a signed, independently acknowledged fallback.
  An explicit operator preference can still change the strict order.
- **`role` is an open string.** Known values `lan` / `tailscale` / `public`
  get styled chips + icons on the phone. Anything else (`wireguard`,
  `zerotier`, `netbird-eu`, whatever the operator wants) renders with a
  generic "Custom VPN" treatment and the raw role label. No enum, no
  validation, no normalization — `role` is preserved exactly as emitted
  so HMAC canonicalization round-trips.
- **`priority` is strict, 0 = highest.** If priority-0 is reachable the
  phone uses it; reachability never promotes a lower-priority candidate
  over a higher one. Reachability is only the tiebreaker for candidates
  that share the same priority. This is the DNS SRV priority/weight
  contract — known-good semantics, nothing new to debate.
- **Reachability probes are per surface.** Standard routing probes the current
  Dashboard's lightweight `/api/health`, falling back to heavyweight
  `/api/status` only for confirmed legacy missing-route responses; otherwise it
  probes an explicitly configured API `/health`,
  with Relay `/health` used only for Relay-only records. Relay socket selection probes the
  candidate's own Relay `/health`; a healthy Dashboard or API listener never
  vouches for Relay on another port. Results are cached independently by
  candidate and surface, so a Relay outage cannot poison healthy standard chat,
  Manage, sessions, or Vanilla Hermes voice.
- **Status is not readiness.** Dashboard `/api/status` remains the source for
  auth-flow, topology, resource-pressure, and component diagnostics after route
  selection. It never gates route reachability or Gateway wake. Timeouts, 5xx,
  429, and ordinary 401 responses from `/api/health` stay on the lightweight
  path; only a real 404 or anonymous legacy `no_cookie` shape may fall back.
- **Standard routing never waits for Relay secrets.** Cold route selection uses
  the active connection's already-persisted Dashboard candidates immediately.
  Compatibility recovery of legacy Relay-only endpoint metadata may hydrate the
  hardware-backed paired-device store only after Gateway availability settles;
  it cannot hold route probes, Dashboard auth, or ticket mint behind Keystore.
- **Relay endpoint normalization is path-aware and idempotent (amended
  2026-08-20).** A Relay candidate may name its base, its terminal `/ws`
  socket route, or its terminal `/health` route using HTTP(S) or WS(S).
  Android removes that terminal route segment once and derives sibling
  `<base>/ws` and `<base>/health` routes. Root bases therefore map to `/ws`
  and `/health`, while `/relay`, `/relay/ws`, and `/relay/health` all map to
  `/relay/ws` and `/relay/health`. Arbitrary path probing is prohibited.
  Authorities, ports, IPv6 literals, and custom path prefixes are preserved;
  user info, queries, fragments, malformed URLs, relative segments, and
  ambiguous encoded separators fail closed. Plain HTTP/WS continues to require
  the existing explicit trusted-LAN/VPN consent.
- **Network-change re-probe**: Android's `ConnectivityManager
  .NetworkCallback.onAvailable` / `onLost` triggers a re-probe. If a
  higher-priority candidate became reachable after a network transition,
  the phone reconnects to it; if the current one became unreachable, the
  phone falls through to the next candidate in priority order.
- **Relay retry state is route-aware.** Transport-failure streaks are scoped to
  the Relay socket URL, so one LAN failure plus one Tailscale failure cannot
  evict Tailscale as though it had failed twice. Automatic route replacement
  preserves the accumulated exponential-backoff attempt; explicit user/network
  handoff and a successful socket open reset it. If every Relay surface is
  unavailable, the standard route remains stable while Relay retries the last
  configured socket with bounded backoff.
- **TTL defaults by role** (informational — operator can override at
  pair time): `lan` → 7 days, `tailscale` → 30 days, `public` → 30 days,
  unknown role → 7 days (conservative). The longer `tailscale` default
  reflects that the tailnet is a *secure transport* (WireGuard end-to-end
  encryption + device identity) — not that the link is TLS. A
  `tailscale` candidate can carry a plain `transport_hint = "ws"` and
  still be encrypted; that's WireGuard, not TLS. See
  [`user-docs/architecture/connection-security.md`](../user-docs/architecture/connection-security.md).
  Plaintext-`ws://` consent still gates any candidate with
  `transport_hint = "ws"`.

**Canonicalization for the HMAC signature:** `canonicalize()` in
`plugin/relay/qr_sign.py` uses `json.dumps(sort_keys=True,
separators=(",",":"), ensure_ascii=True, allow_nan=False)`. Nested dicts
are sort-keyed; **arrays preserve their emitted order** (priority is
meaningful, not alphabetic). Role strings are embedded verbatim — no
`.lower()`, no `.strip()`. A regression test in `plugin/tests/
test_qr_sign.py` exercises this for mixed-case and non-ASCII role
values so a future refactor can't silently divergence the canonical form.

**Pin store:** `CertPinStore` continues to key by `host:port`, unchanged.
Role doesn't participate in the pin key — if the operator points two
roles at the same hostname they'll share a pin (which is correct: same
cert, same pin). The role → hostname mapping lives in the per-device
endpoint record in DataStore, read by the Paired Devices screen to
render one row per `(device, endpoint)`.

**Backward compatibility:**
- `hermes: 1` and `hermes: 2` QRs continue to parse. When `endpoints` is
  absent, the phone synthesizes a single priority-0 candidate of
  `role: lan` (or `role: tailscale` if the top-level `host` matches the
  Tailscale CGNAT pattern `100.64.0.0/10` or a `.ts.net` suffix — same
  heuristics `TailscaleDetector` already uses).
- `hermes: 3` is the first version that *requires* `endpoints`. The
  bump is bookkeeping only; the parser is version-liberal
  (`ignoreUnknownKeys = true` already, plus a nullable `endpoints`
  field for the intermediate period when the server emits v3 but some
  phones haven't updated yet).

**Alternatives rejected:**
- **Layer Noise / libsignal over WSS.** The operator owns both endpoints
  and the transport is already TLS-terminated by the operator's chosen
  path (Tailscale / reverse-proxy / WireGuard). A second crypto layer
  adds complexity without defending against any threat in our model.
- **Auto-promote reachability over priority** ("LAN is flaky, switch to
  Tailscale even though priority-0 works"). Breaks operator intent; the
  operator might have a reason for preferring LAN (zero egress billing,
  lower latency, local-network-only policy). Strict priority keeps the
  operator in charge.
- **Close-vocabulary `role` enum.** Would force a release every time an
  operator spun up a new mesh VPN. Open-string + known-values-display
  map gives us the UI polish for common cases and zero friction for
  unusual ones.

### 25. First-class Tailscale helper as optional hermes enhancement (2026-04-19)

**Problem:** the one piece of first-party upstream remote-access work
([PR #9295](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/pull/9295) —
Tailscale Serve integration) is open but unmerged. Our current
`TailscaleDetector` is informational-only. We want Tailscale to be a
first-class supported mode today, without forking upstream.

**Decision:** Ship a thin Tailscale helper in `plugin/relay/tailscale.py`
that mirrors PR #9295's contract — keep the relay loopback-bound, let
`tailscale serve --bg --https=<port> http://127.0.0.1:<port>` terminate
TLS + identity. The helper is **optional** (no-op when the `tailscale`
binary is absent) and **auto-retires** when upstream lands the canonical
`hermes gateway run --tailscale` flag (detection via a one-shot capability
probe; helper prints an `[info]` pointing at the canonical path and
exits 0). Same pattern `hermes_relay_bootstrap/` uses for the
session-API endpoints.

**Surface:**
- `plugin/relay/tailscale.py` — thin module: `status()`,
  `enable(port=8767)`, `disable(port=8767)`, `canonical_upstream_present()`.
  All shell out to `tailscale` CLI and return structured dicts; no new
  daemon, no new state.
- `scripts/hermes-relay-tailscale` — shell shim mirroring `hermes-pair`
  pattern for scriptability and older Hermes builds. Current upstream supports
  generic plugin CLI command dispatch, so native `hermes <subcommand>` should
  be preferred when available.
- `install.sh` gets an optional step [7/7]: detect `tailscale` binary;
  if present and the operator hasn't declined, offer to run
  `tailscale serve --bg --https=8767 http://127.0.0.1:8767`. Skipped
  silently if binary absent, `TS_DECLINE=1` set, or non-interactive
  shell without `TS_AUTO=1`.
- `plugin/pair.py --mode auto` calls `tailscale.status()`. If a `.ts.net`
  hostname is available, emit a `role: tailscale` endpoint at the next
  available priority after any `role: lan` entries.

**Why this is the right shape:**
- **Loopback-bound stays loopback-bound.** The relay keeps listening on
  `127.0.0.1:8767`; Tailscale handles the TLS + external reachability.
  No change to the relay's security posture.
- **`tailscale serve` already handles auth** via tailnet ACLs + device
  identity. We don't layer a second auth on top — the relay's existing
  bearer-token session auth covers the application layer.
- **Pins work unchanged.** The `.ts.net` hostname's cert is issued by
  Tailscale's internal CA; TOFU pin captures it on first connect, same
  mechanism as any other wss cert.
- **Graceful absence.** Operator without Tailscale sees zero noise. All
  failure modes exit non-fatal.

**Upstream-merge retirement:** when PR #9295 lands, `canonical_upstream_present()`
returns True (detected via `hermes gateway run --help | grep tailscale`
or a `hermes.version >= X.Y.Z` gate — the exact probe is TODO until
the PR lands and we see what its contract looks like). Helper then
no-ops with a log line pointing at `hermes gateway run --tailscale`.
`install.sh` gains an `# TODO(upstream-merge #9295):` comment marking
the exit criteria. Same removal pattern as other compatibility overlays:
keep the helper until a released core build exposes the native path, then
delete the local shim instead of layering another abstraction on top.

**Alternatives rejected:**
- **Bundle our own `tailscaled` daemon.** Replaces Tailscale's existing
  user-facing install / login flow with a worse one. Operators already
  have Tailscale installed or don't — meeting them where they are is
  strictly better.
- **Wait for upstream PR #9295.** Unclear merge ETA; we'd ship v0.4.x
  with the first-class-Tailscale UX paper-thin while waiting.

## ADR 26 — Rich cards via inline `CARD:{json}` line markers

**Status:** Accepted (v0.7.x) — phone-side Phase A. Upstream adapter parity is a separate follow-up (Phase B).

**Context.** The chat feed needed a way to surface structured content — skill results, approval prompts, link previews, calendar entries, weather — as discrete Material 3 cards instead of drowning them in markdown. Upstream `hermes-agent` has zero rich-content abstraction in its platform adapters (`gateway/platforms/base.py` exposes `send()` + `send_image()` + `edit_message()` with no blocks or embeds). Discord uses no `discord.Embed()` at all, Slack uses Block Kit only for the `exec-approval` dialog, and the base class only hints at rich surfaces via the `REQUIRES_EDIT_FINALIZE` attribute for DingTalk AI Cards.

We already had a working precedent: the `MEDIA:` marker in assistant text gives the LLM a lightweight way to attach files that works identically across every streaming endpoint we support (`/v1/runs` + `/api/sessions/{id}/chat/stream` + `/v1/chat/completions`). Cards follow the same recipe.

**Decision.**

1. **Wire format — `CARD:{json}` on its own line.** Parser in `network/handlers/ChatHandler.kt` mirrors the media-marker path: dedicated line buffer, dedupe set, single-line regex, finalize pass on turn/stream complete, reload pass in `loadMessageHistory`. Multi-line JSON is disallowed so the line-buffer strategy stays trivial; escape newlines in string fields as `\n`.

2. **Data model (`data/HermesCard.kt`).** `@Serializable` with `ignoreUnknownKeys = true` so newer agents emitting fields the phone build doesn't know about never crash the parser. Unknown `type` values render via a generic fallback (title + body + fields + actions), so the surface degrades gracefully when we add new built-ins server-side.

3. **Built-in types (Phase A).** `skill_result`, `approval_request`, `link_preview`, `calendar_event`, `weather`. `approval_request` intentionally mirrors the Slack `exec-approval` 4-button pattern (Allow / Allow Session / Always Allow / Deny → map to actions with `style: "primary"` / `"secondary"` / `"danger"`) so future upstream parity (Phase B) is just adapter-side translation, not a data-model rethink.

4. **Accent vocabulary.** `info` / `success` / `warning` / `danger` — semantic, not raw hex, so the renderer pulls from `colorScheme` and dark/light themes stay coherent.

5. **Action dispatch.** `mode` is one of `send_text` (default), `slash_command`, `open_url`. All three route through `ChatViewModel.dispatchCardAction`, which records a `HermesCardDispatch` stamp on the owning message before forwarding — so the card collapses into a "Chose: X" confirmation even if the side effect (browser launch, server round-trip) throws. `open_url` resolves at the UI layer (needs `Context`); the other two reuse `sendMessage` because slash commands are plain text to the server.

**Why markers and not structured SSE events.** A `card.available` event alongside `tool.completed` would be cleaner on the wire but would require a server patch upfront and would NOT work on `/v1/chat/completions` — which is the one endpoint every upstream deployment supports. The marker approach ships today across every endpoint with zero server dependency. If/when we decide structured events are worth the bootstrap cost, the parser can fan out; the `HermesCard` data model stays.

**Why `CARD:` not `<hermes-card>...</hermes-card>`.** Matches the existing `MEDIA:` shape exactly — LLMs have an easier time producing consistent markers when every rich-content construct uses the same grammar. A future delimiter swap (e.g. fenced code blocks) is easy if the flat marker turns out to be fragile in practice.

**Tradeoffs accepted.**
- Marker leakage: if the LLM gets confused mid-turn the raw `CARD:{...}` line can appear in a bubble. We mitigate by leaving unparseable lines in the content (visible artifact beats silent drop) and by including the marker contract in the same section of `prompt_builder.py` as `MEDIA:`.

**Server-side session sync (shipped alongside Phase A).**

Each [com.hermesandroid.relay.data.HermesCardDispatch] carries a `syncedToServer` flag. On the next chat send, `CardDispatchSyncBuilder.buildSyntheticMessages` materializes every unsynced dispatch into an OpenAI-format `assistant` (with `tool_calls`) + `tool` (with `tool_call_id`) pair under a synthetic tool name `hermes_card_action` — a namespaced name the upstream dispatcher will never try to execute, it's a historical audit record only. The arguments object carries `card_key` / `action_value` / `card_type` / `card_title` / `action_label` / `action_mode` / `action_style` so the LLM has enough context to describe the interaction even if the card itself gets trimmed from rolling window memory. Pairs are spliced into the same request-body slot as voice-intent synthetic messages (`voiceIntentMessages` param — name is historical, the param accepts any synthetic-message JsonArray); once the API client accepts the request, `ChatHandler.markCardDispatchesSynced` flips every dispatch's flag so subsequent turns don't re-emit. Commit-timing matches the voice-intent path exactly (post-handoff) so a thrown request-building exception leaves dispatches unsynced for the next try.

*Update (2026-07, HRUI-001):* the top-level `messages` array these pairs originally rode on the sessions/runs SSE payloads was never parsed by native upstream — the context was silently dropped on those transports. The payload builders (`HermesChatPayloads.kt`) now deliver synthetic history through channels upstream actually consumes: tool-call pairs render as a plain-text digest folded into the per-turn ephemeral system prompt (`system_message` on sessions, `instructions` on runs, the `system` message on completions), and plain realtime-voice turns ride a real history channel where one exists (completions `messages` splice, runs `conversation_history`). The digest is per-turn context, not persisted server-side session history.

**Phase B (deferred — not v0.7.x).**

Contribute a `gateway/rich_cards.py` helper upstream + Discord/Slack adapter translations. Discord gains its first real embed usage; Slack reuses the existing Block Kit path. Plain-text platforms (Signal, SMS) fall back to a markdown render of the same card. Same playbook as the current compatibility-overlay model: ship locally while the shape is proving out, then retire the local marker path once a released core build exposes the native card surface. Held until real phone-side card usage surfaces concrete fidelity issues worth translating for.

## ADR 27 — Desktop control native shell uses Tauri v2 with CLI fallback

**Status:** Superseded by ADR 37 (2026-07-13). Retained as historical context.

**Context.** The desktop computer-use surface needs more than a terminal prompt once it graduates from experimental CLI use. Safe control needs a tray icon, always-visible observing/control chip, local grant prompt, task log, settings, and an emergency stop that is available even when no terminal window is open. At the same time, the existing TypeScript CLI and daemon are already the durable thin-client surface and must keep working for operators, headless boxes, and scripting.

**Decision.** Use Tauri v2 (Rust + static web UI) for the native tray/overlay shell. Keep the core desktop tool router, pairing state, grant model, and policy logic in the existing TypeScript CLI first. Rust stays thin and native-specific: tray, overlay window, hotkey, installer/sidecar integration, and later OS-level screenshot/input helpers.

**Overlay UX refinement (2026-05-17).** The desktop overlay should behave like a compact Conjure-style pill, not a mini management card. It is a small transparent always-on-top status window anchored bottom-center to Tauri's monitor work area so it sits just above the taskbar; the full management UI remains in the tray/dashboard. The pill dynamically sizes to its current label (`Observing`, `Paused`, `Offline`, or `Unavailable`) instead of reserving a fixed dashboard-width capsule. On Windows the tray shell reasserts topmost with `SetWindowPos(HWND_TOPMOST | SWP_NOACTIVATE)`, strips native chrome styles, and marks the overlay click-through so the pill cannot steal focus or expose a titlebar.

**UX tiers.**
- **Easy:** pair once, tray runs, compact visible pill shows Observing / Control Active / Paused / Disconnected, and pause or emergency stop is always reachable from the tray, dashboard, or hotkey.
- **Standard:** full tray menu with Devices, Revoke, Task Log, Settings, grant history, and a settings panel.
- **Advanced:** CLI + `hermes-relay daemon` + JSON policy and scripts remain first-class forever.

**Seamless pairing requirement.** The Tauri app must reuse the current `hermes-relay pair` flow, QR/code payloads, `~/.hermes/remote-sessions.json`, and relay `/sessions` device management. A successful Easy-tier pair should leave the tray connected, the overlay chip visible, and Devices / Revoke / Task Log / Settings / Emergency Stop reachable from the tray. Local revoke must also clear active computer-use grants.

**Tray click behavior (2026-05-17).** Tauri's tray menu can appear on left click by default, so the app disables left-click menu display and reserves left click for opening the dashboard. The native management menu remains on right click and through explicit menu events, preventing a single tray click from trying to show both a menu and the main window.

**Control refresh wiring (2026-05-17).** Dashboard controls, tray menu actions, and overlay status all read the same Rust daemon state. Control commands must release the daemon mutex before asking for the resulting daemon status; otherwise pause/stop can deadlock by trying to lock the same mutex twice. Mutating commands emit `dashboard://refresh`, the dashboard guards against stale overlapping refreshes, and the overlay listens for the same event in addition to its fallback poll.

**Desktop GUI refinement (2026-05-17).** The desktop dashboard should reference the Android app's visual discipline and shared Hermes branding, not copy its mobile navigation. The Tauri shell uses the Chevron Compass logo from the repo brand assets, keeps the sidebar navigation-only, and places Start / Pause / Emergency Stop in a sticky topbar so critical daemon controls stay reachable at short window heights. The Android reference remains useful for graphite surfaces, dense operational spacing, short labels, and visible state-first controls.

**Default blocklist baseline.** Computer-use policy starts with password managers, credential vaults, MFA/passkey/OS credential prompts, banking/brokerage/payment apps, crypto wallets, OS security/admin settings, and private-key or token surfaces blocked by default. Advanced users can narrow or extend that baseline through `~/.hermes/desktop-control.json`; the Easy tier keeps it on.

**Why Tauri.**
- Small binaries and system webview match the thin-client posture better than Electron.
- Tray, always-on-top windows, native dialogs, hotkeys, signing, and Rust interop cover the missing safety UX.
- React keeps UI implementation close to the existing TypeScript stack.

**Alternatives rejected.**
- Electron is too heavy for a background "desktop hand" helper.
- Pure WinUI3 / SwiftUI / platform-native stacks increase maintenance cost across platforms.
- CLI-only plus node tray does not give a strong visible overlay and grant-prompt story.

**Compatibility rule.** Phases 1-4 of desktop computer-use must keep working fully in the CLI and daemon with no Tauri dependency. The Tauri app is the Windows Easy/Standard wrapper and primary installer surface, while `hermes-relay daemon` remains the durable advanced/headless backend. The tray installer bundles the compiled CLI as a Tauri sidecar so normal pair/daemon/devices/task-log workflows do not depend on a separate PATH install. When the tray starts the daemon, it also provides a local grant bridge so assist/control requests can open the Grant Requests view for visible approval instead of silently granting host input.

## ADR 28 - Desktop Android pairing parity and one active tray relay

**Status:** Superseded by ADR 37 (2026-07-13). CLI pairing behavior remains.

**Context.** The first Windows tray pass made the desktop surface testable: real tray icon, click-through overlay pill, sticky daemon controls, dashboard refresh wiring, and shared Hermes branding. The next gap is product parity with the Android pairing/settings experience. Android already has the right model: pairing is a first-class route, endpoint candidates make LAN/Tailscale/public routes visible, auth failures separate API health from relay session auth, and advanced settings are tucked behind expandable sections instead of crowding the default screen.

**Decision.** Track the next desktop implementation in `docs/plans/2026-05-17-desktop-android-pairing-parity.md`. The Windows Tauri tray app should default to dark mode, present one active paired relay instance for now, support manual pairing and pasted pairing invites, expose LAN/Tailscale/manual endpoint choices when available, and require explicit confirmation before replacing the active desktop pairing. Visible "Tier" settings and "Easy tier" copy should be removed from the tray UI; CLI/daemon/JSON configuration remain the advanced operator path without being represented as a user-selectable app tier.

**Terminal and diagnostics refinement (2026-05-17).** After pairing parity, the tray dashboard adds task-based Terminal / CLI and Diagnostics routes. Terminal / CLI opens the remote TUI in a real terminal and converts the active relay into copyable standard `hermes-relay shell`, `chat`, `daemon`, `status`, `tools`, and `doctor` commands so users can move between GUI and terminal workflows without hunting through docs. The CLI resolver reads the tray-selected active relay from `~/.hermes/desktop-control.json`, so copied commands omit `--remote` after pairing and reserve it for explicit one-off overrides. If the app is only using its bundled sidecar, the tab nudges the user to install the CLI shim instead of copying full sidecar paths into normal workflows. Diagnostics keeps local install/session checks visible in the tray and runs `hermes-relay doctor --json` through the bundled sidecar, preserving the CLI as the source of truth for install triage.

**Pairing invite URL and desktop consent repair (2026-05-17).** Host-side pairing now prints a paste-friendly `hermes-relay://pair?payload=...` invite URL alongside the QR payload, and `/pairing/mint` returns the same value as `pairing_url`. Desktop accepts raw JSON, base64 JSON, or the invite URL in the Paste invite flow. The desktop CLI now correctly uses `relay.code` as the one-shot relay pairing code; the top-level `key` remains the Hermes API bearer for direct HTTP chat. The tray dashboard also exposes an explicit active-relay desktop-tool consent grant/revoke control so users do not need to drop into a TTY just to allow the daemon.

**Optional `hermes` alias (2026-05-17).** The desktop CLI installer no longer creates `hermes` / `hermes.cmd` by default. That alias is useful for Orca and upstream-style `hermes` workflows because it opens the paired remote Hermes session, but it can shadow a real local hermes-agent install. Alias management is therefore explicit through `desktop/scripts/hermes-alias.ps1` and `desktop/scripts/hermes-alias.sh`; both scripts enable, disable, or report status and only touch aliases that point to `hermes-relay`.

**Implementation constraints.**
- Do not change Android as part of the desktop pass.
- Keep CLI and daemon behavior intact.
- Keep Rust config deserialization backward-compatible with existing `tier` values while removing the visible selector from the tray UI.
- Keep multiple stored sessions compatible with `~/.hermes/remote-sessions.json`, but present exactly one active desktop relay in the tray UI until multi-instance desktop UX is explicitly approved.
- Use a collapsed Advanced section for low-frequency controls such as computer-use flag, emergency hotkey, overlay tuning, raw relay URL override, and blocklist.

## ADR 29 - Voice output uses streaming TTS as renderer, realtime as agent mode

**Status:** Implemented baseline (2026-05-18).

**Context.** The first relay-mediated realtime voice path made provider PCM,
Android `AudioTrack` playback, waveform metrics, and barge-in testable. It also
exposed a correctness issue: when normal chat speech is sent to a realtime
voice-agent provider as a conversational prompt, the provider can answer
differently from the Hermes chat response. We patched the current path with a
`render_mode="verbatim"` bridge, but that is still instruction-following on a
conversational provider rather than a true speech renderer.

**Decision.** Treat deterministic assistant narration and realtime voice agents
as different output modes.

- `streaming_tts_renderer` is the default target for normal assistant speech,
  pre-tool-call status lines, long-task filler, and final response narration.
  It receives final Hermes text and should emit exact audio without answering
  conversationally.
- `realtime_agent` is reserved for speech-to-speech, provider turn-taking,
  provider tool-call event experiments, and comparison testing.
- Hermes remains the owner of chat text, tool execution, approvals, and final
  answers. Provider-emitted tool-call events are scaffolds unless a later
  explicit integration changes that contract.

**Provider direction.** Grok streaming TTS (`xai_tts`) is the first renderer,
with OpenAI streaming TTS (`openai_tts`) added as the next renderer. Existing
Hermes `/voice/synthesize` remains the fallback path, and ElevenLabs remains a
lab comparison adapter. Keep Grok/OpenAI Realtime providers in the lab and relay
for agent-mode testing and comparison.

**Shared broker behavior.** The voice output broker owns verbatim rendering,
PCM waveform levels, first-audio latency, chunk-gap metrics, playback, barge-in
cancel, fallback selection, and short spoken tool/wait status lines. These
behaviors should not be reimplemented separately in every provider adapter.

## ADR 30 - Desktop surface plugins and built-in Herm launcher

**Status:** Amended by ADR 37 (2026-07-13). The CLI plugin commands remain;
the tray plugin view and embedded PTY do not.

**Context.** The desktop tray already owns a local xterm/PTY host for the
remote Hermes Relay TUI. Herm (`liftaris/herm`) is a separate OpenTUI dashboard
for Hermes, published as `herm-tui`, and should be installable without folding
its code into Hermes-Relay or replacing the default relay TUI path.

**Decision.** Add a small desktop surface plugin registry to the CLI and Tauri
tray. The first built-in descriptor is Herm:

- source: `https://github.com/liftaris/herm`
- package: `herm-tui`
- binary: `herm`
- install/update: prefer `bun add -g herm-tui`, fall back to `npm install -g herm-tui`
- launch: prefer installed `herm`, fall back to `bunx herm-tui` or `npx --yes herm-tui`
- resume: use `-c` for installed and fallback launchers

The registry describes plugin tabs, status cards, keybindings, and session
actions for the dashboard. The CLI exposes `hermes-relay plugins`; the tray
adds a Plugins view with Install, Update, Open, Resume, and Embed actions.
Embedding reuses the existing xterm/PTY host and records the running surface as
`plugin:<id>` so the dashboard can distinguish Herm from the default Relay TUI.

**Why built-in first.** Herm is a known terminal surface with simple package
manager semantics. A built-in descriptor gets install/update/launch UX working
now while keeping dynamic third-party plugin loading out of the trusted desktop
surface until signing, permissions, and manifest validation have an explicit
design.

**Compatibility rules.**

- Bare `hermes-relay` remains the default remote Relay TUI path.
- Plugin installation is optional and does not mutate relay pairing or session
  token state.
- Plugin fallback launchers are convenience paths only; a user can still manage
  `herm-tui` directly with Bun or npm.
- The tray must keep external terminal launch available when embedded PTY focus,
  resize, or shortcut behavior needs a fallback.

## ADR 31 - Desktop Chat tab and first-run chat route

**Status:** Superseded by ADR 37 (2026-07-13). Chat remains a CLI/TUI surface.

**Context.** `fathah/hermes-desktop` is useful as a product reference for a
chat-first desktop surface and first-run setup, but Hermes-Relay's desktop app
is a thin Tauri client that should not fork a separate Electron chat stack.
The durable local source of truth is still the paired relay session in
`~/.hermes/remote-sessions.json` plus the existing `hermes-relay chat` CLI
path. Some users also need chat-only access to a Hermes WebAPI gateway before
or instead of pairing a relay.

**Decision.** Add a tray Chat tab with route selection:

- Paired relay mode is the default whenever `selected_url` resolves to a stored
  session. It spawns the bundled CLI sidecar as `hermes-relay chat --json` with
  the active relay URL, so auth, session creation/resume, gateway events, and
  cancellation remain shared with the CLI.
- Direct Gateway/API mode is available when no relay is paired or when the user
  selects it explicitly. The tray saves only `chat_gateway_url` in
  `~/.hermes/desktop-control.json`; the optional API key is passed to the
  sidecar as an environment variable for the current chat turn and is not
  persisted.
- The direct API worker probes `/api/sessions/probe/chat/stream` first, then
  `/v1/runs`, mirroring the Android WebAPI capability split.
- The tab owns only chat UX: transcript, stop, retry, new chat, clear, setup
  diagnostics. Models, providers, memory, skills, schedules, and richer agent
  management remain future plugin panels rather than core tray navigation.

**Compatibility rules.**

- Relay pairing remains required for daemon, terminal/TUI, devices, grants, and
  desktop tool routing.
- Direct Gateway/API mode is chat-only and must not imply desktop-control
  consent or a paired relay session.
- The default relay TUI and plugin terminal surfaces must remain available
  unchanged.

## ADR 32 - Realtime Agent uses provider preamble before relay-forced Hermes

**Status:** Accepted for Realtime Agent correction (2026-05-22).

**Context.** Realtime Agent is supposed to feel like a provider-native
speech-to-speech session while Hermes remains the governed brain and tool
authority. Recent forced-Hermes routing protected correctness by sending
current data, tool, memory, and confirmation requests through Hermes, but it
could regress the audible turn shape by cancelling the provider response and
using local status TTS before Hermes ran. That makes the feature feel like the
old STT -> Hermes -> TTS pipeline instead of a native realtime agent.

**Decision.** Relay-forced Hermes turns must use this sequence:

- Provider owns speech recognition and yields the final user transcript.
- Relay detects that the transcript must go to Hermes.
- Relay asks the active realtime provider to speak one short acknowledgement,
  for example "I'll check Hermes.", without calling tools or adding detail.
- After that provider audio drains, the relay starts the Hermes run and mirrors
  clean Hermes tool/progress/confirmation state into the UI.
- Hermes returns a compact authoritative function result.
- The same realtime provider speaks the final natural summary from that result.

**Rules.**

- Hermes remains the only path for tools, memory, current data, research,
  side effects, durable context, and confirmations.
- Android must not read raw Hermes tool output aloud. Raw output belongs in
  logs/debug trace; spoken output is a provider-generated summary after the
  compact Hermes result.
- Local spoken status lines are fallback or long-wait affordances only. They
  should not replace provider-native pre-Hermes acknowledgement during a healthy
  Realtime Agent turn.
- The relay must suppress provider tool calls during the preamble phase; the
  preamble is acknowledgement only, and Hermes starts after the preamble drains.

## ADR 33 - Realtime Agent foregrounds short Hermes turns and promotes long ones to background tasks

**Status:** Accepted, phased (2026-05-24). Default-on at feature GA, gated by a
prerequisite provider-idle-tolerance spike (Phase 0). Supersedes the
blocking-broker assumption inside ADR 32's sequence; ADR 32's preamble ->
forced-Hermes -> provider-summary shape is preserved for the foreground tier.

**Context.** Today a Realtime Agent turn runs Hermes *synchronously inside the
provider event pump*: `_pump_provider_events` awaits `_handle_provider_tool_call`
-> `_run_brokered_tool`, which streams the entire Hermes SSE run to completion
before the pump consumes the next provider event (`broker.py`). This is correct
and lowest-latency for short Q&A, but it has two costs that grow with task
length:

- The provider realtime socket sits attached-but-idle for the whole run (a live,
  billed, audio-clocked WebSocket parked for tens of seconds during research,
  multi-tool, or desktop/build tasks).
- The tool surface already advertises a background vocabulary
  (`hermes_run_task`, `hermes_get_status`, `hermes_cancel`, `hermes_confirm`)
  and a `hermes_run_status` state machine, but `hermes_get_status` /
  `hermes_cancel` as *provider* tool calls are unreachable mid-run because the
  pump is parked. Only the client->relay `response.cancel` path can interrupt.

The blocking `await` is also an *implicit mutex*: it serializes the three audio
sources that can produce `voice.output_audio.delta` (see "Who speaks" below) so
they never overlap. Removing it requires replacing that mutex with an explicit
floor owner.

**Who speaks (confirmed against both supported providers).** Up to three mouths
exist; only one is active per phase today because of the blocking await:

1. **Realtime provider** - xAI `grok-voice-latest`, OpenAI `gpt-realtime-2`.
   Both run with `turn_detection: None` (relay owns turn boundaries; no server
   VAD) and audio output modality. Speaks the pre-Hermes acknowledgement and the
   final post-result summary.
2. **Relay TTS render** - `xai_tts`/`openai_tts` via `_render_provider_audio`.
   A separate, non-realtime synthesizer used as the forced-summary fallback and
   the legacy render path. Emits the *same* `voice.output_audio.delta` wire event
   as the provider, so Android cannot distinguish them.
3. **Android local TTS** - the `should_speak` long-wait filler, driven by
   `hermes.run.progress`. Client-side, not the provider.

Because all three converge on one Android `AudioTrack`, **floor arbitration must
happen relay-side, before bytes reach the socket.**

**Decision.** Keep three turn classes; make promotion automatic and default-on,
with the relay as the single explicit floor owner.

- **Tier A - Foreground (short Q&A).** Unchanged from ADR 32: provider preamble
  -> relay-forced Hermes (still awaited) -> provider summary. Lowest latency,
  trivial floor. This remains the path for any turn that completes inside the
  promotion grace window.
- **Tier B - Promoted (long task detected late).** Start in Tier A. If the
  Hermes run has not produced a final result within a grace window
  (`promote_after_ms`, default ~6000ms, tunable), the relay *detaches* the run
  from the pump: the run continues as a tracked `asyncio.Task`, the pump resumes
  consuming provider events, and the provider speaks a short "I've started that -
  I'll let you know" handoff. Progress continues via `hermes.run.progress`. When
  the background run completes, the relay injects the result as a tool result and
  requests a provider summary at the next floor-idle moment.
- **Tier C - Explicitly durable.** `hermes_run_task(mode="background")` returns a
  run handle immediately (no grace window). For tasks the model/profile knows up
  front are long (research, builds via desktop tools, multi-step). Same
  completion-injection path as Tier B.

Promotion is the default behavior, not a flag. Grace-period promotion preserves
Tier A latency for the common case and only forks when a run actually proves
long, so the user never has to pick a mode.

**The relay is the single floor owner.** A per-session floor state
(`idle | provider_speaking | hermes_filler | result_pending`) gates every audio
source:

- Only one mouth may hold the floor. The provider holds it by default.
- A completed background result does **not** barge in. It is queued as
  `result_pending` and spoken only when the floor returns to `idle` (provider
  finished, user not mid-utterance). Provider VAD being off means the relay
  controls `response.create`, so it can withhold the summary until the floor is
  clear.
- Android local filler (`should_speak`) is suppressed whenever the provider holds
  the floor; it is a Tier B/C long-wait affordance only.
- Relay TTS render (mouth 2) may only fire when it owns the floor and the
  provider has drained, exactly as the forced-summary fallback does today.

**Settings (ample, per ADR intent).** Surface in Voice Settings -> Realtime
Agent, with relay-side `realtime_voice` config as source of truth and per-profile
override:

- `promotion_enabled` (default true) - master switch; false pins Tier A blocking.
- `promote_after_ms` (default ~6000) - grace window before Tier B handoff.
- `background_default_mode` - whether ambiguous long turns prefer promote vs.
  stay-foreground.
- `spoken_handoff` (default true) - speak the "I've started that" line on
  promotion vs. silent + visual only.
- `progress_spoken_after_ms` / `progress_repeat_ms` - reuse existing
  `_HERMES_SPOKEN_PROGRESS_*` knobs, now configurable.
- `result_delivery` - `speak_verbatim` (default; the realtime provider reads
  the authoritative answer word for word, with relay TTS as the validator's
  fallback) vs. `speak_when_idle` (provider/model summary), `notify_then_speak`
  (chime/visual, speak on user re-engage), or `visual_only`.
- `max_background_runs` - concurrent background runs per session (default 1 for
  the MVP; the existing single-`hermes_task` field assumes 1).

**Protocol additions (relay <-> Android, additive).**

- `hermes.run.promoted` - run moved to background; carries `run_id`,
  `promote_after_ms`, `spoken_handoff`. A false `spoken_handoff` is also the
  foreground turn boundary; when true, the following `voice.response.done` is
  the boundary. In both cases the background socket, task card, cancellation,
  progress, and result delivery remain active.
- `hermes.run.background_completed` - background run finished; precedes the
  provider/relay summary.
- Extend `hermes.run.progress` with `tier` and `floor` so the client can render
  background state distinctly (e.g. a persistent "working on: ..." chip).
- `hermes_get_status` / `hermes_cancel` become genuinely reachable as provider
  tool calls in Tier B/C because the pump is no longer parked; no schema change.

**Prerequisite (Phase 0 spike) — RESOLVED 2026-05-24.** The spike asked how xAI
and OpenAI realtime sessions behave when held open and idle. Verdicts (see
`docs/realtime-voice-poc.md`): **OpenAI `hold-floor-ok` (empirical** — survived
10/20/30s idle with clean post-idle audio); **xAI `hold-floor-ok`** (shipping
Realtime Agent already holds `xai_realtime` sessions open across between-turn
idle with `turn_detection: None` + resume TTL; relay-host probe retained as a
regression check, not a precondition). The premise was also superseded in
implementation: Tier B closes the pending provider call with an interim ack
rather than holding an open response, so the socket only sees the normal
between-turns idle gap. This unblocked default-on at the short-window scale.
See the 2026-07-08 revision below for xAI's later 900s idle-expiry behavior.

**Phase 0 revision (2026-07-08).** The xAI verdict was scoped to between-turn
idle and broke at the 15-minute scale: a live event log showed xAI closing a
quiet conversation with "timed out after 900.0 seconds due to inactivity"
(~896s of zero events after a background-run summary finished speaking).
Follow-up probe runs proved no keepalive works: neither uncommitted silent PCM
nor acknowledged `session.update` pings reset xAI's 900s timer. The broker now
treats an idle timeout as routine provider-session expiry: it logs the expiry,
closes the attached Android websocket cleanly while idle, emits no `voice.error`,
and lets the next user turn open a fresh provider conversation seeded from the
durable Hermes session. Full findings live in `docs/realtime-voice-poc.md` →
"Idle tolerance" → "Revision (2026-07-08)".

**Rules.**

- Hermes remains the only path for tools, memory, current data, research, side
  effects, durable context, and confirmations (unchanged from ADR 29/32).
- Exactly one audio source may hold the floor at a time; the relay enforces this
  before audio reaches Android. Background results never barge in.
- Android must not read raw Hermes output aloud; spoken output is always a
  provider (or relay-fallback) summary of the compact Hermes result.
- Promotion must be cancel-safe: a promoted/background run is cancelable via both
  the provider `hermes_cancel` tool and the client `response.cancel` path, reusing
  `_cancel_active_hermes`.
- A turn must never strand: if a background run completes while the WS is
  detached, the result is replayed through the existing event-ring/resume path on
  reattach.

**Open questions / risks.**

- Floor arbitration is the hard part and the existing `native_forced_*` /
  `_should_forward_provider_response_event` suppression machinery is already the
  most fragile code in `broker.py`. Concurrency stresses it most; the floor-owner
  state machine should *replace* ad-hoc suppression, not stack on top of it.
- Concurrent background runs (`max_background_runs > 1`) are out of scope for the
  MVP; the session model assumes a single `hermes_task`.
- "Notify then speak" result delivery needs an Android affordance (chime +
  chip + tap-to-hear) that does not yet exist.

**Phased rollout.**

1. **Phase 0** - provider-idle-tolerance spike (above). Gate for default-on.
2. **Phase 1** - introduce the relay floor-owner state machine under the current
   blocking behavior (no functional change), with tests that prove single-floor
   invariants.
3. **Phase 2** - Tier B grace-period promotion behind `promotion_enabled`,
   default **off**, validated on long-task transcripts.
4. **Phase 3** - flip `promotion_enabled` default **on**; add Tier C
   `mode="background"`; ship the Voice Settings surface.

### 34. v1.0.0 Vanilla-Hermes-First Relay Plugin Boundary (2026-06-16)

**Status:** Accepted.

**Context:** v1.0.0 made a plain upstream Hermes install sufficient for Android
chat, Manage, and voice. The remaining Relay code should be treated as a
third-party plugin surface: useful and powerful, but additive and cleanly
manageable. The legacy installer still creates side effects outside the upstream
plugin manager, including an editable/root package install, `.pth` bootstrap,
systemd user unit, shell shims, and external skill-path entries.

**Decision:** Treat `plugin/` as the plugin-manager-owned root for the current
repo layout and document the canonical install identifier as
`Codename-11/hermes-relay/plugin`. The plugin manifest carries the tool list,
dashboard plugin metadata stays under `plugin/dashboard/`, and the plugin CLI now
includes `hermes relay doctor` as the single read-only diagnostics surface for
agents and operators. The optional legacy compatibility startup hook is managed
by `hermes relay compat status/install/remove` rather than an undocumented
installer side effect. New compat hooks load the bootstrap implementation from
`plugin/hermes_relay_bootstrap/`; the repo-root `hermes_relay_bootstrap/`
package remains only as a backward-compatible import shim for old `.pth` files.
The Python package, plugin manifest, dashboard manifest, and relay runtime all
use version `1.0.0` for this stable line.

**Runtime boundary:**

- Vanilla upstream Hermes owns chat, Manage, dashboard auth, dashboard voice, sessions,
  runs, responses, capabilities, skills, and toolset discovery.
- Relay owns pairing, terminal, bridge/device control, relay voice extensions,
  remote access, media relay, notification companion, desktop tools, and the
  dashboard Relay tab.
- `plugin/hermes_relay_bootstrap` is legacy compatibility only. It must not be a
  hidden prerequisite for the Vanilla Hermes path.

**Why not add a repo-root `plugin.yaml` now:** Current upstream imports directory
plugins from the directory that contains both `plugin.yaml` and `__init__.py`.
Adding a root manifest while the actual `register(ctx)` entry point remains in
`plugin/__init__.py` would make the repository look installable as a root plugin
but fail or mislead at load time. A future repo restructure can move the plugin
entry point to root or split a dedicated plugin repository; until then the
subdirectory install is explicit and correct.

**Operational rule:** `hermes plugins remove hermes-relay` removes only the
plugin tree. It cannot clean every legacy external artifact today.
`hermes relay compat remove` owns the bootstrap `.pth` hook, while
`uninstall.sh` remains the cleanup surface for legacy service/shim/root-package
installs until plugin lifecycle hooks or plugin-owned service commands replace
those pieces.
The legacy installer now calls `hermes relay compat install` for the hook, and
the uninstaller delegates hook removal to `hermes relay compat remove` when that
command is available, falling back to deleting only the Relay `.pth` file.

## ADR 34 — Structural fence between vanilla-upstream and Relay network surfaces

**Status:** Accepted (2026-06-17).

**Context.** The project's load-bearing invariant — *the Vanilla Hermes (no-plugin) path
must work against unmodified upstream hermes-agent* — is enforced only by
convention and `CLAUDE.md` prose, never by structure or test:

- All network code lives in one flat `network/` package. The client classes are
  cleanly *named* by surface (`HermesApiClient`, `GatewayChatClient`,
  `DashboardApiClient` → upstream; `RelayHttpClient`, `RelayVoiceClient`,
  `ConnectionManager`, `ChannelMultiplexer` → relay), but nothing *prevents* a
  Vanilla-Hermes-path file from importing a relay client. The discipline is a code-review
  rule, not a compiler/lint rule.
- The Vanilla Hermes path has never been exercised against *true* vanilla upstream. The
  staging server runs a fork with relay routes compiled into `api_server.py`, so
  "vanilla-only" is an aspiration validated by review, not by CI. When upstream
  renames or drops a route the app depends on, nothing surfaces it until a user hits
  it on a server we don't control.

**Decision.** Three net-additive, behavior-preserving changes:

1. **Package fence.** Split `app/.../network/` into `network/upstream/`,
   `network/relay/`, and `network/shared/`. Upstream/relay client and transport
   code are physically separated; genuinely-neutral utilities and the routing-seam
   abstractions live in `shared/`.
2. **Enforced import rule (Konsist).** A JUnit-level architecture test asserts
   `upstream` imports nothing from `relay` and vice-versa, and that `shared` imports
   neither concrete client. The boundary becomes a *failing test*, not a convention.
3. **Vanilla-upstream contract test.** A CI job clones a pinned, unmodified upstream,
   boots it with the bootstrap compat hook absent, and asserts the Vanilla-Hermes-path
   route surface exists (`404` = fail; `401/400/405` = pass — existence, not agent
   behavior). A scheduled run against upstream `main` acts as a drift siren.

**Placement calls (decided by reading, not the plan's guess):**

- **`ChatHandler` → `upstream/`** (not `shared/`). Per ADR 3, chat connects directly
  to the API server / gateway and the relay carries only bridge + terminal. The
  handler is fed solely by upstream transports, imports only upstream *models*, and
  has zero relay imports.
- **`VoiceAudioClient.kt` is split three ways**: the `VoiceAudioClient` interface and
  the `AutoVoiceAudioClient` router (interface-only deps) → `shared/`;
  `StandardHermesVoiceClient` → `upstream/`; `RelayVoiceAudioClientAdapter` (imports
  `RelayVoiceClient`) → `relay/`. Keeping them co-located would force one file to
  import both worlds.

**Rejected alternatives.**

- **Full `ConnectionViewModel` transport-strategy split now.** The largest clarity
  win (it's the one true god-object leak — it instantiates both worlds and branches
  on auth state inline), but also the riskiest change. Deferred until the fence makes
  the seam obvious; tracked as a follow-up.
- **Custom ktlint/detekt lint rule** to enforce the boundary at the lint gate.
  Deferred in favor of a Konsist test: the repo's lint step is a
  ktlint-or-android-lint fallback chain with no architecture tooling, and a custom
  rule needs a separate Gradle-plugin / lint-AAR module. The Konsist test reuses the
  existing JVM unit-test infra for a fraction of the setup. Promote to a lint rule
  later if lint-gate enforcement is wanted too.

**Consequences.**

- A future file cannot quietly pull a relay client into the Vanilla Hermes path — CI fails.
- `shared/` stays genuinely neutral (`ConnectivityObserver`, `EndpointResolver`,
  `HermesLanDiscovery`, `ProfileApiUrlResolver`, voice routing seam).
- The contract test converts the standing "upstream-only path never actually
  validated" caveat into an automated signal, on our pinning cadence.

## ADR 35 — In-flight Chat recovery is session-centric and client-checkpointed

**Status:** Accepted (2026-07-10).

**Context.** A session-backed agent turn can outlive Android's Activity, process,
or WebSocket. Current upstream Hermes can reattach an exact live Gateway session
and reports whether it is still running plus its user/partial-assistant text, but
that server snapshot does not contain Android presentation state such as live
reasoning, tool/subagent card phases, lifecycle captions, pending ask cards, or a
client-owned background-task chip. Persisted history becomes authoritative only
after the turn settles and therefore cannot restore the in-between UI.

**Decision.** Treat Chat recovery as session-centric instead of request-centric:

1. Persist active session-backed turns as a bounded set in the shared Android
   DataStore, keyed by connection/profile context plus durable session id, with a
   24-hour expiry. Store each visible assistant state and server-issued ask,
   including clarify multi-select semantics, but
   never an entered password/secret or approval response.
2. On reopen, restore that UI immediately, then recover in this order: exact
   `session.activate` using the saved live id; `session.resume` using the durable
   id; bounded, positionally anchored history reconciliation.
3. Separate **detach** from **cancel**. Lifecycle teardown and Gateway
   session/profile/draft/Thread navigation release local callbacks without
   `session.interrupt`; selecting a running sibling reclaims its exact live id.
   Explicit Stop and connection switches still interrupt, and SSE navigation
   remains exclusive because that transport cannot multiplex live sessions.
4. Apply the same history fallback to sessions-SSE transport drops and route
   handoffs. A final persisted transcript replaces the checkpoint and clears it.
5. When `session.resume.inflight` includes user corrections, restore the bounded
   corrections in server order exactly once between the original user turn and
   the partial assistant response.

**Consequences.** Reopening Chat or moving between running Gateway chats can
continue each assistant bubble with its last-known reasoning and tool state
instead of inventing a second prompt or empty spinner. Detached siblings keep the
shared Gateway event socket alive and reconnect it after route loss. Tool state
that changed while no client was attached remains explicitly last-known until a
new event or authoritative history reconcile arrives. Older Hermes builds without
live activation degrade to durable history recovery.

## ADR 36 — Play preflight precedes public Android distribution

**Status:** Accepted (2026-07-12).

**Context.** The Android tag workflow historically created the public GitHub
Release—including the installable sideload APK—before uploading a Production
draft to Play. Play can surface compatibility and pre-launch failures only after
an artifact is uploaded, so a Play-detected release blocker could arrive after
the project had already committed publicly to the same version on GitHub. A
manual Play rollout button did not protect the earlier sideload publication.

**Decision.** Stable Android releases use two explicit phases:

1. **Private Play preflight.** A manual workflow builds and signs final artifacts
   from `dev` or untagged `main`, runs source and minified-DEX compatibility
   checks, and uploads the Google Play AAB as a Production draft. It records a
   short-lived proof keyed by version and Git tree hash; no GitHub Release or
   public sideload APK is created.
2. **Public approval.** After Play's pre-review and pre-launch results are
   reviewed, a separate workflow on `main` requires explicit confirmation and
   the exact preflighted tree. It creates the stable tag. The release workflow
   changes the existing Production draft to `completed` first and creates the
   public GitHub Release only after Play accepts that submission.

The proof uses the Git tree rather than commit SHA so the required `dev` →
`main` no-ff merge may create a different commit without invalidating identical
release contents. Any content change invalidates approval and requires another
private preflight.

**Consequences.**

- Play-detected blockers can stop a release before the sideload APK is public.
- Stable tags cannot bypass missing preflight proof, changed contents, missing
  Play credentials, or a failed Play production submission.
- Pushing a stable tag remains a recovery path, but the tag workflow enforces
  the same tree proof.
- Play reports remain an additional signal, not a complete correctness proof;
  local/CI tests and final DEX scanning remain mandatory.

## ADR 37 — Desktop is CLI/TUI plus an optional Windows management tray

**Status:** Amended (2026-08-11; originally accepted 2026-07-13).

**Context.** The Windows Tauri shell grew from a tray convenience into a second
desktop client with Chat, embedded PTYs, sessions, plugins, voice, diagnostics,
settings, an overlay, and its own daemon ownership. That duplicated the CLI/TUI
contract, obscured which surface was authoritative, and made a background tray
helper carry a full WebView application architecture.

**Decision.** Hermes-Relay desktop has exactly two deliverables on the
`desktop-v*` production track (historical `cli-v*` tags remain immutable):

1. `hermes-relay`, the primary cross-platform CLI and terminal TUI. Interactive
   behavior, pairing, sessions, daemon management, grants, audit, diagnostics,
   plugins, chat, and voice remain CLI-owned.
2. `hermes-relay-tray`, an optional Windows-only management tray. It may display
   a single compact popup for connection state, paired Hermes hosts, the selected
   host's access policy, pending grants, daemon controls, authorized clients,
   activity, and settings. It invokes the installed CLI rather than duplicating
   its state or protocol logic. Daemon state includes PID liveness and the current
   User/Administrator privilege level; elevation is an explicit UAC-confirmed
   daemon action, never a permanently elevated tray. Desktop computer use is a
   per-host CLI-owned policy, while the tray displays and invokes that contract
   rather than maintaining private settings.

The management popup is deliberately not a second Hermes desktop client. It must
not contain chat, an embedded terminal or PTY, agent sessions, plugins, voice, an
always-on overlay, or a general diagnostics dashboard. Pairing may open the real
CLI until an equally narrow native pairing dialog exists. The Windows installer
places one CLI binary and the tray binary beside each other under
`~/.hermes/bin`; there is no private bundled sidecar.

**2026-08-11 access and host amendment.** Stored relay URLs represent distinct
Hermes hosts, not peer devices on one relay. The compact host selector lists
those local pairings and places **Pair another host...** inside the selector;
when none exist, the selector becomes the single Pair action. Peer sessions for
the selected relay appear only under Settings as authorized clients and may be
revoked there.

Host access is persisted locally, keyed by canonical relay URL, and defaults to
`ask`. `trusted` permits the regular command and file tool surface while keeping
task-scoped screen/input approval. `full_access` also permits screen, keyboard,
and mouse use without expiring task grants for that host. Full Access never
bypasses relay authentication, local audit, revocation, emergency stop, or UAC
boundaries. The daemon may connect in a locked zero-tool state under `ask`, so
starting connectivity does not itself require or imply a tool grant.

**Consequences.**

- A narrowly scoped Tauri WebView is allowed for the popup; xterm, tray-owned
  PTY/process state, and full desktop-client assets remain excluded.
- Pending computer-use requests retain a CLI command and are also resolved in a
  focused in-window dialog, so normal tray operation never requires opening a
  terminal merely to approve or reject a request.
- Normal-user operation remains the default. Administrator desktop-tool access
  is available through an explicit UAC prompt, and elevated daemon lifecycle
  actions retain that privilege boundary.
- The tray shows host access, active grant and expiry, alerts on pending local
  approval, supports immediate cancellation, and warns when an Administrator
  input grant is active.
- Local desktop-tool audit entries use a backward-compatible structured event
  envelope (`tool.completed`, category, duration, request ID, and optional
  process exit code). The tray derives its live, filterable Activity view from
  that local log and treats non-zero exits as attention-worthy even when the
  tool handler itself returned normally. Successful tray management actions
  append compatible `management.completed` events, keeping daemon, host-access,
  grant, client-revocation, startup, pairing, and update changes in the same
  local timeline without creating a second state store.
- Settings shows only a short Activity preview. A dedicated detail view owns
  filters, event expansion, and confirmed local-history clearing. Non-zero
  subprocess exits are warnings rather than user-actionable Issues; only handler
  failures and aborts contribute to the Issues count.
- Host cards navigate to local detail rather than implicitly switching the
  daemon. Host selection is an explicit detail action, and an optional local
  alias is stored beside the selected relay URL without mutating the paired
  session or remote server identity.
- The tray is a small Rust/Tauri process; NSIS packages it with the same compiled
  CLI released separately.
- **2026-08-14 process-containment amendment.** Treat every external executable
  launch as a bounded resource. Periodic UI refreshes must be single-flight and
  coalesced across windows, must not start another refresh while one is pending,
  and must apply a timeout, termination, and retry backoff to every child.
  Grant-card discovery reads the local bridge directly rather than polling the
  complete management snapshot. Static probes such as the CLI version, registry
  settings, and optional ADB availability are cached or refreshed only when the
  owning setting changes. The tray must remain useful when a probe fails and
  must never amplify that failure into an unbounded subprocess queue.
- Tray lifecycle, refresh, and child-process diagnostics are recorded in the
  bounded local `~/.hermes/tray.log`; daemon authentication, transport, and tool-
  router lifecycle remain in `~/.hermes/daemon.log`. Operational logs exclude
  credentials and sensitive command arguments. Management failures are reported
  as failures rather than silently dropped or appended as successful activity.
- Rich full-window desktop chat and management remain upstream desktop-product
  concerns, not a Hermes-Relay surface.
- The CLI package version remains canonical for both binaries and the installer.

## ADR 38 — Dashboard/Gateway is the primary Android connection surface

**Status:** Superseded by ADR 71 for chat fallback semantics (2026-08-31).

**Context.** Android originally treated the API server URL and bearer key as the
identity and prerequisite for every saved connection. The app later gained the
upstream Dashboard/Gateway `/api/ws` transport, dashboard authentication,
native Manage, session control, and dashboard voice. That route now supplies the
complete standard experience, but onboarding and persistence still framed it as
an optional service derived from an API URL. Users with a healthy dashboard were
therefore asked for an API server and sometimes entered fake credentials.

**Decision.** A saved connection represents one Hermes installation and has a
stable identity independent of endpoint URLs.

- **Dashboard/Gateway is standard.** It owns primary chat, dashboard auth,
  sessions, Manage, and Vanilla Hermes voice against unmodified upstream Hermes.
- **API server is optional.** When discovered or explicitly configured, it is an
  API-only chat and advanced headless compatibility surface. Its
  bearer is requested and validated only when that endpoint is configured.
- **Relay is optional.** It adds pairing, terminal, bridge/device control,
  media, notification companion, enhanced voice, and desktop tooling. It never
  becomes a prerequisite for standard chat or management.
- **Relay compatibility shims are narrow and read-only.** When upstream Gateway
  suppresses `image_generate` lifecycle frames with tool progress disabled, a
  paired Android client may poll Relay's `/chat/image-activity` route during
  that active turn. Relay derives start/completion state from the selected
  profile's authoritative Hermes session database without proxying chat.
  Native Gateway lifecycle events take precedence, and absence of the optional
  route silently restores the vanilla behavior.
- **Readiness is capability-based.** Chat, Manage, Voice, Direct API, and
  Relay extensions report their own state. A missing optional endpoint does not
  mark the whole connection unhealthy.
- **Routing is owner-bound.** Standard Chat uses Dashboard/Gateway. Legacy
  API-only records and explicit advanced compatibility selections use the API
  server. Live authentication or reachability never changes an open chat's
  owner. Endpoint discovery may advertise a conventional API route, but does
  not enable it for a Dashboard-owned conversation.

**Product flow.** Normal onboarding asks for one Hermes address, discovers the
Dashboard/Gateway, authenticates through its supported provider, and finishes
with a capability summary. Manual endpoint fields live under Advanced. The
Connections list leads with server identity and available outcomes rather than
ports, keys, or transport names. Existing API-only records and API-first pairing
payloads migrate without behavior loss and remain valid headless configurations.
An API endpoint or Relay can be added later without recreating the connection.

**Consequences.**

- Dashboard-only Hermes connections can chat, manage, use sessions, and use
  Vanilla Hermes voice without fake API credentials.
- API outages do not degrade a healthy Gateway session; they affect only an
  explicit Direct API compatibility conversation.
- Connection storage, diagnostics, backup/restore, route discovery, pairing,
  and profile/session scoping must tolerate independently absent endpoints.
- Legacy API-only users keep working, but public documentation no longer teaches
  that compatibility configuration as the normal path.

## ADR 39 — Android dashboard redirect auth uses native PKCE

**Status:** Superseded by ADR 40 (2026-07-27).

**Context.** Android originally completed redirect-provider dashboard sign-in
inside a WebView and imported cookies. Current upstream Gateway can advertise a
native authorization-code flow with PKCE, bearer refresh, and WebSocket ticket
support. That contract allows the provider to use the user's browser session
without exposing browser cookies to the app.

**Decision.** When `/api/status.auth_flows` contains `native_pkce`, Android uses
an AndroidX Custom Tab and a lifecycle-owned callback bound to literal
`127.0.0.1` on an OS-assigned port. The selected provider, S256 challenge,
redirect URI, and CSRF state are sent to upstream. Verifier/state remain only
in the sign-in coroutine; callback input is bounded and state-validated before
errors or codes are accepted. Tokens are encrypted per connection and attached
only to the exact trusted dashboard base. Native bearer exchange requires
HTTPS, except literal loopback development. Missing capability selects the
legacy cookie/WebView flow; native failures do not silently downgrade.

All dashboard consumers share the same authenticated client policy: Gateway
chat and tickets, Manage and cold prewarm, standard voice, and voice config.
Local sign-out clears cookies and native tokens and closes the cached Gateway
socket.

**Consequences.**

- Redirect-provider sign-in remains in the app task while using the system
  browser's provider session and security posture.
- Process death or cancellation discards the ephemeral authorization and simply
  requires a new attempt.
- Plain-LAN HTTP dashboards must be upgraded to HTTPS before native bearer auth
  is offered.
- Older upstream versions remain usable through the explicitly identified
  WebView compatibility path.

---

## ADR 40 — Android dashboard redirect auth is provider-compatible

**Status:** Amended (2026-08-26).

**Context.** Upstream exposes the supported client authentication contract in
public `/api/status.auth_flows`. Current upstream specifies `native_pkce` as the
preferred system-browser flow whenever advertised, regardless of the redirect
provider's display/configuration name, and retains embedded cookie sign-in for
older gateways or client-local native failures. Android instead restricted
native PKCE to a literal `nous` provider name, so capable self-hosted redirect
providers were incorrectly forced into WebView.

**Decision.** Android selects redirect authentication only from advertised
capability. When `auth_flows` contains `native_pkce`, every interactive
provider, including password-capable providers, uses the `/auth/native/*`
broker in a system Custom Tab with an
ephemeral loopback callback, S256 verifier, state validation, encrypted bearer
storage, and exact-origin attachment. Android passes a provider selector when
the gateway requires one; hosted Nous retains upstream's compatibility behavior
where the gateway chooses its single native-eligible provider.

Missing `native_pkce` uses the dashboard cookie flow. A client-local native
failure (transport/listener, secure storage, or unsupported native response)
automatically continues through that same compatibility flow. Explicit
provider denial, server rejection, and rate limiting remain visible and do not
start a second authorization attempt. The cookie flow will:

- open `/auth/login?provider=...&next=...` in a full-screen embedded sign-in
  destination with a normal app bar rather than a modal WebView;
- preflight that route without cookies or redirect-following and, when the
  provider authorization URL declares a different canonical Dashboard
  `/auth/callback`, begin the real browser transaction on that canonical base;
- allow the provider to return through the dashboard's public
  `/auth/callback` when that is the provider's configured callback;
- import only cookies observed on the configured dashboard origin;
- verify the imported session through `/api/auth/me`;
- persist the successfully authenticated canonical base as a Dashboard-only
  preferred route only after explicit review and same-installation validation
  through non-empty `/api/status.install_id` values; mismatches are rejected,
  while an older gateway missing either ID requires explicit confirmation;
- reject a foreign `http://127.0.0.1`, `localhost`, or `[::1]` `/callback`
  navigation instead of following or importing it.

Failures are classified without recording codes, state, tokens, provider
responses, or other authentication material. Public cleartext dashboards are
rejected; explicitly configured RFC 1918 and Tailscale-IP dashboard routes
retain the same HTTP allowance as their existing cookie sessions. If the
provider redirect from a private route declares a canonical HTTPS dashboard
callback, Android begins cookie fallback on that canonical origin so the
temporary PKCE cookie and callback remain same-origin.
After the cookie session verifies, that HTTPS base becomes the connection's
authenticated Dashboard/Gateway origin, stored separately from network-route
candidates. Android never downgrades its Secure cookies to
the private HTTP route, and the connection's API and Relay routes retain their
existing ownership. The auth WebView permits third-party cookies only for its
short lifetime so compatible federated provider pages can preserve their own
browser state.
Dashboard cookies retain browser-origin ownership. Android never mirrors basic,
OAuth, `__Host-`, or other session cookies between saved/derived LAN,
Tailscale, or public Dashboard hosts, even when they belong to one Connection.
A single HTTPS origin may legitimately move between bare, `__Host-`, and
`__Secure-` cookie names when its trusted-proxy/prefix shape changes. Android
treats those variants of the access token, refresh token, and provider hint as
one logical family: the newest same-origin variant replaces and prunes older
variants so a stale provider cannot outrank the latest verified sign-in.
A legacy cookie-only host change requires sign-in at the new exact host.
Different callback origins over HTTP are accepted only when both selected and
callback hosts are literal loopback/private-overlay addresses, both remain
HTTP, and the identity-provider hop is HTTPS. Same-origin HTTP callbacks retain
upstream's local/VPN behavior. A second public sign-in URL is never a universal
onboarding field: Android starts from one Dashboard address and discovers this
topology from upstream only when redirect authentication requires it.

**Consequences.**

- Provider names no longer override the upstream `auth_flows` capability.
- Self-hosted OIDC uses native PKCE when advertised and otherwise uses its
  registered dashboard callback through the cookie compatibility flow.
- If a provider establishes a browser session without resuming the original
  authorization, Continue sign-in cancels that native attempt before opening a
  fresh one; callback listeners and authorization generations never overlap.
- A private discovery route cannot strand a successful public cookie session
  by returning subsequent Dashboard traffic to a different origin.
- Routes presents the authenticated Dashboard/Gateway origin independently from
  LAN, Tailscale, API, Relay, and other network paths; internal auth roles are
  not user-visible route types.
- Android Manage, Chat, Voice, and onboarding continue to share one verified
  dashboard cookie session.
- Android retains a full-screen embedded WebView only as an advertised or
  client-local compatibility fallback.
- LAN and Tailscale may remain the configured app route while OIDC returns to a
  public HTTPS Dashboard origin. Operators register
  `<public-dashboard-origin>/auth/callback` and set upstream
  `dashboard.public_url` / `HERMES_DASHBOARD_PUBLIC_URL` only when trusted proxy
  headers cannot reconstruct that origin; Android does not require a second
  onboarding field.

## ADR 41 — Android owns full-turn interruption and experimental wake detection

**Status:** Accepted (2026-07-29).

**Context.** Android barge-in previously armed only when speech playback began.
That left agent generation non-interruptible and recreated the microphone/VAD
pipeline at the Thinking-to-Speaking boundary. Upstream voice work established
a safer full-turn lifecycle, quiet calibration before playback, and phase-aware
bare stop behavior. Upstream wake listening is host-local, but enabling that
server listener from Android would capture audio on the wrong machine and
couple Standard voice to non-standard server behavior.

**Decision.**

- Android owns one barge-in listener per active voice response, spanning
  `Thinking`, `Speaking`, and final audio drain on Standard and Realtime paths.
  A turn epoch fences callbacks, and teardown completes before replacement
  capture or another listener can acquire the microphone.
- Optional AEC and noise suppression attach to the listener's `AudioRecord`
  capture session, matching Android's preprocessing contract. Playback session
  IDs are not effect attachment targets.
- Quiet-room RMS calibration occurs before output and freezes at playback
  start. The gate follows upstream's 90th-percentile ambient floor, 3× default
  multiplier, generation/playback minimums, 4,000 RMS ceiling, 500 ms grace,
  and 80%-majority decision window. Calibration frames cannot trigger. The
  renderer drives playback phase, ambient drift resumes only in quiet gaps,
  and grace rearms after gaps of at least one second. Android exposes the
  multiplier and grace for device tuning while preserving upstream defaults.
- Interruption uses the existing active-turn cancellation seam. Late Standard
  stream content and Realtime audio are suppressed. Silencing does not cancel
  a promoted Hermes task; explicit background-task cancellation remains the
  separate destructive intent.
- Configurable stop phrases default to exact bare `stop` and end the active
  voice chat during generation or playback; an empty list disables the feature.
  The phrase remains ordinary agent input outside voice chat, and longer
  requests remain agent input. Existing exact pause/resume controls remain
  phase-gated to Continuous mode.
- A playback interruption arms the upstream-compatible one-shot note for the
  next model-bound Standard turn, expires after 120 seconds, and is carried in
  API-local interface context rather than visible or persisted user text.
  Generation or pre-audio synthesis interruption does not claim that spoken
  output was cut off, and Realtime relies on its persistent provider session
  context.
- Wake-word detection is Android-local, experimental, and off by default. A
  user-started microphone foreground service runs sherpa-onnx for the single
  validated “Hey Hermes” phrase, with an ongoing notification and Stop action.
  No pre-activation PCM leaves the phone.
- Wake and voice share a process-wide microphone lease. Detection releases its
  recorder before entering the existing voice flow and resumes only after voice
  exits. There is no boot receiver or server wake-listener control.
- The KWS model is downloaded and SHA-256 verified on first enable. Preferences
  store enabled state, fixed phrase, strictness, decoder confirmation,
  start-new-session behavior, and a future-safe profile-routing shape. Only
  active-profile preservation is implemented; profile-specific phrases are
  intentionally not claimed.
- sherpa owns temporal confirmation through `numTrailingBlanks`. Android treats
  each non-empty keyword result as a completed event, resets the native stream
  immediately, reuses its equal-sized normalization buffer, and does not
  require the same completed result to recur. Voice
  settings can arm a bounded real-microphone test; test detections report
  success without entering voice or acquiring a second microphone owner.

**Consequences.**

- Standard voice remains Dashboard/Gateway-backed and works against unmodified
  upstream Hermes. Local detection is an Android input affordance, not a Relay
  server dependency.
- The sherpa runtime increases Android artifacts for each packaged ABI, while
  the approximately 6 MB model is device storage rather than APK payload.
- Continuous wake listening has visible microphone and battery cost and
  requires explicit device/acoustic validation before the experimental label
  can be reconsidered.
- The ordinary foreground-service mode may continue listening in the
  background, but it does not launch an activity from the background. It holds
  a detection behind an actionable notification until Hermes is visible.
  Default-assistant integration is a separate Android system role and lifecycle.

---

## ADR 42 — Full assistant wake uses Android's selected VoiceInteractionService

**Status:** Accepted (2026-07-30).

**Context.** The microphone foreground-service preview can detect in the
background, but Android correctly prevents an ordinary background app from
presenting its Activity immediately. Queuing the activation behind a
notification is therefore not equivalent to a default digital assistant.
Accessibility, overlays, full-screen intents, or server-side microphones would
either bypass platform policy, weaken privacy, or break the vanilla-Hermes
boundary.

**Decision.**

- Hermes declares a `VoiceInteractionService` and associated
  `VoiceInteractionSessionService`. Android activates it only after the user
  confirms Hermes as the Assistant role; the app never silently takes the role.
- The always-running interaction service remains lightweight and owns only
  opt-in Android-local sherpa-onnx KWS. Session UI and lifecycle work run in a
  separate process. The system session opens the existing app voice flow with
  `startVoiceActivity`, including the keyguard-supported platform path.
- Assistant KWS and the experimental microphone foreground service are separate,
  mutually exclusive modes. Both use the same model, tuning, privacy boundary,
  and one-microphone handoff. Voice capture, barge-in, and diagnostics retain
  their existing process-wide lease.
- Session state crosses the process boundary through explicit, package-scoped
  broadcasts. Exit/cancel tears down the existing voice flow, finishes the
  system session, and retries local wake ownership only after the microphone is
  free. Process recreation creates a fresh activation rather than relying on an
  in-memory Activity reference.
- The system session defaults to a compact bottom bar and can expand without
  changing turn lifecycle. **Open full voice** disables only the system-owned
  session UI and foregrounds the app-owned Voice surface. It does not create
  another voice session or reacquire the microphone. Back collapses an expanded
  surface first; Back from compact, hide, Stop, or cancel remains terminal,
  while the hidden session still observes the final `Closed` state and finishes
  without cancelling the completed turn.
- Firmware WEB_SEARCH dispatch uses a separate transparent single-task Activity
  that accepts only `android.speech.action.WEB_SEARCH`, requires the protected
  `STATUS_BAR_SERVICE` caller permission and active Assistant role, ignores query
  data, and asks the system-managed interaction service to show a real session.
  Bounded readiness and show-failure cleanup close the trampoline when the platform
  does not accept it. The service re-reads keyguard state immediately before show;
  caller data never decides capture policy.
- Each shown session owns a stable activation identifier. Only an unlocked
  WEB_SEARCH session requests AssistStructure and screenshot callbacks and starts
  listening from the same button press. Extraction is bounded and excludes hidden,
  assist-blocked, and password subtrees; screenshots are optional and byte-bounded;
  captured content never enters logs. Fail-soft app-private staging plus consumed,
  cancellation, and stale markers prevents replay across processes.
- Screen context belongs to one ordinary Standard voice turn, not to the chat
  composer. It is labeled as untrusted, submitted through explicit per-turn
  attachments, retired from later turns when the local turn is created, and deleted
  only after authoritative Gateway or API acceptance. Preflight failure retains it
  for Try again; unsupported routes reject the isolated submission rather than
  dropping context. Realtime Agent neither consumes nor claims the context.
- Activation heartbeats let the main runtime clean up after assistant-process loss.
  Finish and show-failure paths clear pending/watchdog state, while Full Voice
  explicitly transfers ownership before the session overlay stops heartbeats.
  A recreated session process requests the current activation-fenced voice
  snapshot rather than treating its empty local state as authoritative.
- Connection, chat, and voice runtime ownership is application-lifetime in the
  main process rather than Activity-owned. The assistant service may initialize
  that graph and start a turn while no Activity exists; the app UI later binds
  the same ViewModels, recorder, players, clients, and turn state. The isolated
  session process never creates voice collaborators.
- Standard voice remains dashboard-backed and upstream-only. Assistant mode adds
  an Android invocation surface; it does not add or require a Relay/server wake
  endpoint.

**Consequences.**

- Background and locked-screen invocation is mediated by Android's selected
  assistant UI/session rather than an ordinary background Activity launch.
- Locked assistant UI exposes only generic phase and retry status. Transcript,
  response, route-specific errors, diagnostics, and screen context remain hidden
  until the device is unlocked; no-speech retry copy is deliberately content-free.
- Users can leave Hermes selected for gesture/power-button invocation while
  turning continuous KWS off, or remove Hermes through Android's Assistant
  settings.
- Android does not grant third-party assistants Google's dedicated low-power
  hotword DSP integration. Local sherpa inference keeps pre-activation audio
  private but can consume materially more battery than the built-in assistant.
- OEM WEB_SEARCH routing and platform assist delivery remain device behaviors;
  source and host tests do not prove broad firmware compatibility. The exported
  trampoline relies on the protected caller permission plus exact-action,
  active-role, coalescing, and single-session gates. Physical certification still
  covers repeated explicit invocation because Assistant-role ownership alone does
  not authenticate the originating component.

---

## ADR 43 — App-owned voice overlay uses a microphone foreground service

**Status:** Accepted (2026-07-31).

**Context.** A `TYPE_APPLICATION_OVERLAY` remains visible over another app, but
it does not make its owning process foreground for Android's while-in-use
microphone app-op. The first capture could begin during the foreground grace
window, while later captures opened successfully but received silenced PCM.
Keeping `AudioRecord` in the existing voice runtime was still desirable: wake,
voice capture, barge-in, and diagnostics already share one process-wide owner.

**Decision.**

- Opening the system voice overlay while Hermes is visible starts a dedicated
  service with `foregroundServiceType="microphone"` before the app backgrounds.
  The required ongoing notification explains the microphone access and offers
  a terminal **Stop voice** action.
- The service never creates an `AudioRecord` and never acquires a microphone
  lease. It supplies only the foreground execution capability; the existing
  `VoiceViewModel` and `VoiceRecorder` remain the sole capture owner.
- Overlay Hide, Exit, Open Hermes, voice-mode shutdown, add-view failure, and
  app-task removal stop the service. Notification Stop closes the overlay and
  exits voice mode rather than leaving an unprotected capture surface visible.
- The service is distinct from experimental wake-word listening. Wake remains
  paused during voice and cannot become a second microphone owner.

**Consequences.**

- Repeated overlay turns can receive real microphone PCM after Hermes moves to
  the background instead of Android substituting silence.
- Background overlay use has an explicit persistent privacy affordance and
  cannot silently retain microphone eligibility after the overlay session.
- Android 14+ while-in-use rules require starting this service from the visible,
  user-initiated overlay action; an arbitrary background caller cannot create
  equivalent microphone privilege.

## ADR 44 — Floating pets use one measured-rail behavior director

**Status:** Accepted (2026-08-01).

**Context.** An app-level pet is visually pleasant only when its movement reads
as intentional and never competes with the interface. Treating the entire
Compose or accessibility tree as walkable geometry would make text and controls
accidental terrain, while independently launched animation effects can interrupt
dragging, misrepresent active agent work, or snap to stale coordinates when a
scroll changes measured bounds. Chat adds a special case: the pet should walk on
top of a response bubble without ever covering its text or jumping through it.

**Decision.**

- One root overlay owns position and arbitration. It consumes no transcript or
  control-bar layout space; only the pet-sized target handles pointer input.
- Appearance persists one 60–120% scale, default 100%, that changes art, touch
  target, collision footprint, perch eligibility, and route clearance together.
  The 100% base equals the previous 125% physical size, and legacy stored values
  are rebased to preserve their rendered size; visual and planner geometry may
  never scale independently.
- Screen owners opt in by publishing live-measured perches, obstacles, scrolling,
  and modal visibility. The supported terrain is Chat's composer and eligible
  visible settled message bubbles, Terminal's extra-keys toolbar, root Settings
  summary/category cards, Appearance section cards, and the persistent status
  strip on Settings/Appearance/About. No accessibility-tree scan or
  arbitrary-Composable discovery is permitted.
- Registration does not make a surface rectangle walkable. Bubble interiors
  remain protected obstacles; only an explicitly derived edge rail or touchdown
  with exact collision-validated endpoints is autonomous terrain. A validation
  failure waits locally instead of projecting or snapping to invented geometry.
- Direct interaction has priority over agent activity, followed by a pending
  response visit, autonomous roaming, and idle reactions. Activity clips remain
  truthful because locomotion is eligible only while Hermes is idle.
- Drag/drop changes placement without changing the roaming preference. The held
  and falling states suspend autonomous movement until the placement and landing
  animation settle, then an enabled pet resumes from the valid landing surface.
- Autonomous, recovery, and direct drag/drop routes are distinct motion/debug
  kinds. Recovery and direct manipulation cannot be reused as autonomous route
  eligibility. When a layout update has already placed the pet inside a measured
  obstacle, recovery is limited to the shortest bounded straight egress to a
  clear edge and stops there.
- A response visit is a deterministic bounded terrain journey. Nearby responses
  use the direct composer/gutter/bubble excursion. Farther visible responses
  require a complete chain of settled message-top rails with no hop over 210 dp;
  sparse chats without that chain defer the visit. The newest response gets the
  full cross and greeting, then the pet may inspect one to three successively
  older visible rails according to temperament before retracing the same bounded
  journey. A measured bubble too narrow for walking may contribute a centered,
  zero-width touchdown when at least 35% of the pet width is supported; it is a
  transient route step, never an idle or patrol surface. Unsafe geometry and interactive response rows are skipped rather than
  crossed, and a sparse gap ends exploration instead of inventing a ledge. The
  active planner uses the same rail-overlap launch point as the debug graph,
  walking there before takeoff and backtracking past dead-end candidate edges.
- Settled Chat uses one text-safe habitat order: the measured side pocket beside
  the newest settled bubble, then its raised top edge, then the outer composer
  corner. A changed habitat is reached from the live coordinate, never snapped.
- Settings terrain may be published dynamically by reusable components, but it
  remains explicit opt-in measured geometry with owner scroll/modal state. The
  app never turns every card, heading, control, or semantics node into terrain.
  Root Settings and Appearance explicitly publish selected card tops. Their
  bounded planner may tour several connected levels in either direction and
  must retrace the exact selected legs; the same maximum transfer length still
  rejects any card without a pet-sized clear approach.
- Temporary suspension preserves screen coordinates. Scrolling stops movement
  but does not reclassify the route, re-dock, teleport, or dim the pet. Settings,
  Appearance, and About hide it while a dialog owns the surface. Routes without
  an approved rail use the persisted logical-edge home.
- Motion states correspond to physical movement: directional walking for
  horizontal travel, jump to the apex, fall through descent and manual-drop
  settling, and held during drag. Airborne duration grows with route length;
  anticipation, turn pauses, cycle-quantized walking, shadow height, and landing
  squash are presentation polish around those honest states.
- Calm, Balanced, and Playful alter cadence and cap older-bubble exploration at
  one, two, or three stops. App animation settings, foreground/activity state,
  scrolling, dialogs, Android animator scale, and TalkBack touch exploration
  always take precedence.
- Debug builds may expose a default-off Pet path inspector anchored below the
  app header and Android status-bar inset, leaving header navigation and actions
  accessible. It starts as a narrow collapsed bar, moves only from an explicit
  grip, snaps horizontally, persists normalized viewport placement, re-clamps
  after viewport or size changes, and exposes a reset action. A recoverable PASS
  mode collapses it and leaves only the unlock control interactive; non-control
  regions and the diagnostic Canvas remain click-through. It expands on demand.
  **Terrain** is the default balanced view; **Plan** isolates selected and active travel, and
  **Full** adds protected bounds, footprint, raw labels, gate, and locomotion
  state. The views distinguish measured terrain, narrow-bubble touchdown points,
  collision-checked candidate routes, the selected out-and-back route with
  directional arrows and numbered stops, and the solid currently active route.
  The planner keeps an event-driven lookahead ready while behavior pacing is
  idle, refreshes it on terrain or supported-waypoint changes, and treats an
  in-flight transfer as atomic. Freeze snapshots only the visualization while planning continues. The
  expanded actions can disable the persisted overlay request entirely, and
  diagnostics are cleared when Developer Options are locked.
- Installed Petdex pets use the same renderer and planner without manifest edits
  or asset conversion by the user. The catalog preview resolves through the live
  renderer and names the exact direct, mirrored, fallback, or mirrored-fallback
  row for each supported action.

**Consequences.**

- Adding another roam surface requires an explicit measured-rail registration
  and ownership of its scroll/modal state; it is not automatically inferred.
- Bubble visits remain fun but deterministic and text-safe. When geometry is not
  provably safe, no visit is preferable to a partially obscured message.
- Position, activity truth, accessibility behavior, and Petdex fallback semantics
  share one source of runtime truth instead of drifting across route-local effects.

## ADR 45 — Provider/model reasoning levels use an optional capability overlay

**Context.** Upstream Hermes owns model discovery and selection. Its
`model.options` contract supplies provider/model identities and may report a
reasoning boolean, but not every provider exposes an authoritative list of
selectable effort values. A client-side provider table would drift, while making
Relay mandatory would break the Vanilla Hermes path.

**Decision.**

- Upstream `model.options` remains the source of provider/model identity. Relay
  never invents models or gates model selection or chat.
- Android normalizes that inventory before publication: repeated rows with the
  same case-insensitive provider slug are merged, repeated exact model IDs
  within that provider are collapsed, and different provider slugs remain
  separate choices even when their labels and model IDs match. Compose keys use
  the provider slug plus exact model ID, never a display label or list position.
- When available, the optional Relay `POST /relay/model-capabilities` overlay
  resolves capability metadata for the exact, profile-scoped `{provider, model}`
  pairs supplied by the client. A remote caller needs a paired session with an
  active `chat` grant; loopback operator calls may omit it.
- Resolution uses this precedence: an exact upstream effort list, then an exact
  Relay effort list, then an explicit upstream `reasoning: false`, then the
  canonical advisory set `none`, `minimal`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`,
  `max`, `ultra`.
- Only a coherent provider/model identity may produce an exact result. API model
  aliases may contribute only when their provider resolves uniquely. Missing,
  malformed, unsupported, unauthenticated, or failed overlay calls keep the
  advisory set instead of disabling the control.
- Exact lists are selectable truth for the next request. Advisory lists are
  compatibility choices, not a claim that every value is provider-supported.
  An effort confirmed by the active session may remain visible as current state
  even when it is no longer selectable for a new request.
- Requests are schema-versioned and bounded to 64 exact pairs. Relay may perform
  bounded provider discovery using host-owned credentials, but returns only
  capability metadata. Credentials, credential fingerprints, probe details, and
  internal cache keys never cross the route.
- Primary UI copy describes **available levels** for exact results and
  **standard levels** for advisory results. Provider source and overlay details
  belong in diagnostics, not in the normal composer.

**Consequences.** Vanilla Hermes remains complete without Relay. A connected
Relay can narrow choices after capability discovery without changing the model
inventory. Old Relay versions, a missing `chat` grant, network failures, and
unsupported providers fail soft to the same stable advisory behavior. Cached,
dynamic, and refreshed catalogs are idempotent at the Android publication
boundary, while provider-specific aliases and reasoning capabilities retain
their exact route identity.

## ADR 46 — Session pin and archive state follows upstream profile storage

**Status:** Accepted (2026-08-07).

**Context.** Android's session drawer originally kept pin and archive sets in
Compose `remember` state. The controls appeared to work until the drawer or app
was recreated, at which point neither set had a durable owner. Current upstream
Hermes exposes both fields on stored session rows, returns them from the
Dashboard session list, and accepts `pinned` or `archived` through the existing
profile-aware session PATCH route. The official client treats the server row as
durable truth. A separate Android registry would drift across clients and could
collide when two connections or profiles contain the same session id.

**Decision.**

- Android maps upstream `pinned` and `archived` fields into `ChatSession`; the
  drawer is a stateless renderer of those fields.
- Gateway-mode lists request `archived=include` through the active connection
  and effective profile's Dashboard route so archived rows survive recreation
  and remain available for restore.
- Pin/unpin and archive/restore use the same profile-scoped Dashboard PATCH
  contract as rename. API-server mode uses its official session PATCH for pins.
  Its current list cannot include archived rows, so Android does not offer an
  archive action there that would become unrestorable after restart. Relay
  endpoints are never required.
- Mutations update the visible row optimistically, roll back on a failed write,
  and refresh from server truth after success. Revision and scope-generation
  fences prevent older completions or a profile/connection transition from
  changing the newly selected namespace.
- Deleting a session needs no metadata cleanup on Android because there is no
  local flag index; the next server list simply omits the deleted row.

**Consequences.** Pin state, and archive state on the standard Dashboard path,
now survive Android process and drawer recreation and agree with other official
clients. Identical session ids in different profiles or installations remain
isolated by their server database. Hosts predating the upstream fields fail the
mutation visibly and retain their previous row rather than reporting local-only
success.

---

## ADR 47 — Android follow-up queues are destination- and run-owned

**Status:** Accepted (2026-08-08).

**Context.** Android previously represented queued composer submissions as one
ViewModel-wide list of strings. Queue presentation and completion dispatch both
consulted the mutable visible session, so switching between two running Gateway
sessions could display and submit a follow-up in the wrong server conversation.
Composer attachments and voice context were also read at dispatch time rather
than captured with the queued text.

**Decision.**

- Each queued item snapshots its connection/profile context key, stored session,
  configured transport, originating local run id, attachments, voice context,
  and stable queue id at submission.
- The queue tray projects only items owned by the visible context and session.
  Session/profile switching does not rebind or globally expose queued items.
- A run must complete before its own items become eligible. Detached Gateway
  completion carries the exact live session generation and reconciles only the
  checkpoint with that same durable and live identity, preventing a late older
  completion from releasing a newer same-session queue.
- Dispatch occurs only while the exact destination is visible and idle. A route
  change, deleted session, connection replacement, cancellation, or unavailable
  destination removes only the affected queue and reports the loss where user
  action is required.
- In-flight checkpoints persist bounded queued text and voice context. Attachment
  bytes are deliberately excluded from Preferences DataStore; restoration drops
  such an item with a visible review-and-resend notice rather than sending an
  incomplete prompt.
- Durable session metadata and live tool-card identity remain independent. Queue
  ownership consumes their existing connection/profile and checkpoint seams but
  does not move metadata or Compose expansion state into the queue.

**Consequences.** Concurrent Gateway sessions retain independent queues and no
completion can redirect a follow-up through the currently visible chat. Queue
editing restores only the selected item's composer payload. Process restoration
is deterministic for bounded text queues, while attachment restoration fails
closed instead of silently changing the submitted turn.

## ADR 48 — Android profile switching lives in a context shelf

**Status:** Accepted (2026-08-08).

**Context.** Agent Passport had become both an inspection/configuration surface
and the primary profile switcher, while the Session Drawer already had the
separate responsibility of listing the active profile's conversations. Profile
switching was therefore buried, duplicated across picker implementations, and
the old `default` alias collapsed two different identities: following the
server's sticky default and explicitly selecting the root profile named
`default`.

**Decision.** Chat owns a compact collapsible Profile Shelf directly below its
top app bar. The header toggles it; the active capsule opens Agent Passport;
inactive avatars switch context; and the fixed overflow plus Passport's Switch
agent control open one canonical full switcher. Presentation order and hiding
remain `ProfilePresentationStore` state owned by `ProfileController`, including
the selected-hidden exception. Local icons remain connection/profile scoped.
Compose renders state and invokes ViewModel actions; it never writes a store.

Server default is represented only by `SERVER_DEFAULT_PROFILE_KEY`/a null
selection. Its resolved agent is grouped once with a home badge and a follow-default
control; the selected request key remains unchanged. Upstream `display_name` is
presentation-only. Descriptions and connection names are not profile names, and
an unresolved default never assumes root identity. A profile named `default` retains its
own request, lock, icon, presentation, and session keys. Selecting either does
not call the upstream sticky-default mutation.

Profile changes preserve the existing `activateGatewayProfile` and
`switchProfileContext` lifecycle. A live Gateway turn detaches and reconciles to
its original session; SSE switching remains disabled while streaming. The
destination restores only its connection/profile/transport-compatible last
session or starts a draft, never hot-swaps a live session. Model/provider,
personality, reasoning, approval, Fast, and YOLO state reset at the ViewModel
context boundary before destination session truth can repopulate them.

New Chat retains the current concrete conversation owner even when the drawer is
browsing All Profiles. A profile choice made from that empty draft transfers an
explicit fresh-draft intent rather than restoring the destination's previous
session. Android persists and generation-fences that intent by exact
connection/profile/transport; it clears only the resumable pointer, leaving the
stored conversation, transcript, and per-owner composer drafts intact.

Phone Threads keep their connection/chat-id ownership when leaving that surface.
They are never transferred into a different profile binding: the atomic header
switch retires provisional or in-progress promotion state before creating the
destination profile draft, while durable inbox rows, promoted sessions,
notification ownership, and session-to-chat-id indexes remain untouched. A
generation fence prevents a delayed promotion from replacing the new draft.

**Consequences.** The hamburger remains exclusively the Session Drawer. Agent
Passport stays focused on inspection and configuration. The drawer may widen
its read-only browse scope to all profiles and organize that combined set by
recency, project, status, or profile; opening a cross-profile row performs the
same explicit profile-context switch as the shelf. Named-profile ownership uses
a deterministic identity accent with an optional per-connection local override,
while Server default remains a neutral home identity; color never communicates
activity or health. The shelf adds no fake
activity indicator, hides for one visible identity, retains 48 dp touch targets,
and exposes meaningful TalkBack actions in compact, large-font, light, and dark
layouts.

---

## ADR 49 — Android text shares become reviewed chat drafts

**Status:** Accepted (2026-08-08).

**Context.** Android users can share selected text between apps, but Hermes
Relay did not advertise a sharesheet target. Treating an external intent as a
message send would bypass composer review, and handling draft/session state in
`MainActivity` or Compose would split ownership from `ChatViewModel` and risk
writing into whichever session happened to be visible during startup.

**Decision.**

- The shared manifest advertises `ACTION_SEND` with `text/*`, so Google Play and
  sideload builds expose the same user-mediated entry point.
- `MainActivity` accepts only non-blank `EXTRA_TEXT` from that contract. A
  process-local identity-fenced handoff retains one pending share across cold
  Compose initialization and prevents an older completion from clearing a
  newer intent.
- RelayApp waits for onboarding and initial chat-context settlement, then asks
  `ChatViewModel` to create a new chat under the already active connection,
  effective profile, and configured transport before navigating to Chat.
- `ChatViewModel` reuses the existing new-chat lifecycle. Gateway turns retain
  their detached background reconciliation; SSE keeps its existing exclusive
  cancellation behavior. No profile, sticky default, or presentation store is
  changed.
- Composer prefill is a buffered one-consumer event. It may wait for Chat to
  compose, is delivered once, and never calls `sendMessage`; submission always
  requires an explicit user action.

**Consequences.** Shared text lands in a fresh, reviewable draft without
crossing profile/session namespaces or creating a new server-side integration.
Non-text attachments and multi-item shares remain outside this contract.

---

## ADR 50 — Android transcript reads are explicitly bounded and intent-specific

**Status:** Accepted (2026-08-09).

**Context.** Hermes now defaults omitted message limits to the latest 500 rows.
Android previously omitted pagination on both the API-server and profile-scoped
Dashboard routes, which silently dropped older history and shifted transcript-
derived edit ordinals in long sessions.

**Decision.** Both transports share one 500-row pagination contract. Complete
user-visible reads page oldest-first and accept legacy envelopes with no
pagination metadata. Reads stop at 50,000 messages or 32 MB of decoded response
payload. Recovery explicitly requests one latest page only while the already
known transcript fits that window; otherwise it uses complete paging to retain
the positional user anchor. Gateway row ids are retained as durable rewind
addresses and rebound from the server after a rewrite. A transcript with no row
ids keeps the older ordinal contract, while a mixed transcript refuses to edit
a row whose durable address is missing. Cancellation propagates rather than
becoming an empty transcript.

**Consequences.** Long session history, sharing, retry, and edit/regenerate no
longer operate on a silent latest-500 subset. Recovery stays cheap for ordinary
sessions without allowing a bounded window to replace the complete visible
history. Durable histories cannot silently downgrade to destructive ordinal
guessing, while older Hermes releases remain compatible.

---

## ADR 51 — Android coding-session context is optional upstream metadata

**Status:** Accepted (2026-08-12).

**Context.** Current upstream Hermes records a session's working directory, Git
branch, and repository root in its session database and returns those fields on
Dashboard session-list routes. It also exposes a read-only profile-wide endpoint
that recovers the pull request a session created from a narrowly validated tool
result. Android previously discarded all of that context, making coding chats
indistinguishable in the session drawer.

**Decision.** Android maps optional `cwd`, `git_branch`, and `git_repo_root`
fields from existing Dashboard list responses. For rows with workspace context,
it asks `POST /api/profiles/sessions/pull-requests` and accepts only a positive
PR number with a non-blank URL. Unresolved active sessions retry on a bounded
cadence and receive one final scan after ending; resolved associations and
terminal misses remain cached. Cache ownership is profile plus session id, and
ambiguous duplicate ids in an all-profile response are never assigned a
transcript result. Android then uses the repository-
scoped `POST /api/git/review/pr-list` view to refresh the matching branch or
known PR number's lifecycle state. The drawer displays only the repository
basename, exact branch, PR number, and lifecycle state; it does not expose host
paths. Both reads are best-effort. A missing route, unavailable GitHub CLI,
malformed response, or API-server-only connection leaves ordinary session
behavior intact and is not promoted to a session-list failure.

**Consequences.** Coding sessions become recognizable without introducing a
Relay dependency or a GitHub credential path. Repository and branch state can
still appear when PR recovery is unsupported, while legacy hosts show no new
badges and active sessions can surface a PR created after their first drawer
refresh without allowing cross-profile cache collisions.

---

## ADR 52 — Desktop RPC is explicitly device-targeted and capability-honest

**Status:** Accepted (2026-08-12).

**Context.** A Relay can retain several authorized desktop sessions, but the
desktop channel historically latched one latest WebSocket. Pairing two PCs could
therefore make an agent command change targets implicitly. The desktop surface
also mixes typed file/process/screen operations with unrestricted terminal and
PowerShell execution. Camera, microphone, and attached-device toggles cannot be
claimed as security boundaries while unrestricted code still runs as the same
Windows user.

**Decision.** Every desktop advertises a stable installation `device_id` and
display name. The Relay keeps all connected desktop WebSockets, accepts a
`device` selector on every client-routed tool, binds pending responses to that
WebSocket, and fails closed when more than one desktop is connected without an
explicit target. Health reports enumerate valid targets, and successful RPCs
identify the resolved target.

Typed tools are the preferred automation surface and declare a capability such
as `files.read`, `files.write`, `process.manage`, `screen.observe`, or
`input.control`. `desktop_terminal`, `desktop_powershell`, detached processes,
and background command jobs declare `system.execute`. This capability is an
escape hatch: at user privilege it can transitively reach files, processes,
USB devices, camera, or microphone through operating-system APIs. The UI must
not present independent hardware-deny toggles as enforceable while
`system.execute` remains enabled.

Existing local policy remains authoritative on each target PC: Ask does not
start the headless tool router without consent; Structured withholds
`desktop_terminal`, `desktop_powershell`, detached process launch, and command
job start; Trusted permits typed and execution tools but retains task grants for
screen/input; Full Access bypasses those task grants for that Relay host.

Hardware policy is separate and per host. USB defaults Disabled and exposes
only typed, serial-bound ADB list, shell, push, pull, install, and bounded
logcat operations. Ask raises the dedicated local approval card for every
operation; Allow requires explicit confirmation. Full Access does not override
the USB policy. Disabled or unavailable backends are omitted from advertised
tools. Microphone and camera remain visibly unavailable until bounded
brokers, active-use indication, and cancellation exist.

The management UI names the legacy no-tools Ask state **Restricted**. A separate
**Ask Every Time** preset advertises each available command, file, screen/input,
and USB operation behind a per-operation local approval; unavailable brokers
remain disabled. New pairings receive Ask Every Time explicitly, while missing
or existing legacy policy records retain their previous fail-closed meaning.

**Consequences.** Agents cannot accidentally execute against whichever PC most
recently sent a heartbeat, and a response from another PC cannot satisfy a
targeted request. Common operations remain typed and auditable while raw shell
power is labeled honestly. Structured mode makes the USB policy enforceable,
and device operations appear as their own local Activity category. Microphone
and camera controls are not shipped as cosmetic switches.

---

## ADR 53 — Desktop management separates host scope from local-PC scope

**Status:** Accepted (2026-08-12).

**Context.** The compact Windows tray had accumulated per-host connection and
authorization information alongside local daemon, update, and application
controls. That made Settings difficult to scan and left common operator tasks—
opening the CLI, viewing the daemon log, running diagnostics, or returning an
elevated daemon to normal user privileges—dependent on external instructions.
The tray must remain a small management utility rather than regrow into an
embedded terminal or general desktop client.

**Decision.** The three top-level destinations remain Overview, Hosts, and
Settings, with scope determining ownership:

- A Host detail page is the hub for one paired Relay instance. It owns the local
  display name, connection state, Relay address/version, pairing and session
  details, access preset, capabilities, authorized clients, explicit connect,
  re-pair, client deauthorization, and guarded Forget host actions. Opening the
  page never silently selects or connects the host.
- Settings owns this Windows PC and the installed application. It contains
  daemon lifecycle and sign-in behavior, CLI launchers, logs and diagnostics,
  bundle updates, and Help & About. **Start UI at sign-in** controls only the
  per-user tray startup entry. **Start daemon with UI** is a separate opt-in,
  defaults off for existing installs, and never implies elevation. Per-host
  access and client lists do not appear there.
- **Open terminal** starts a normal terminal with `hermes-relay` available.
  **Open Hermes CLI** starts the paired remote Hermes TUI in a real terminal;
  neither action embeds a terminal emulator in the tray.
- **View daemon log** opens the daemon connection/tool-router log. Tray startup,
  refresh, and child-process failures use the separate local tray log so a UI
  failure remains observable even when no daemon is running. **Run diagnostics**
  delegates to the CLI diagnostic contract rather than creating a second health
  model and reports both log locations when relevant.
- Help & About reports UI, CLI, and connected Relay versions and links to the
  documentation, troubleshooting guide, and release notes through the default
  browser. Log and diagnostic shortcuts remain available there as well.

The tray always remains unelevated. **Restart as Administrator...** is an
explicit UAC-mediated action that elevates only the daemon. **Return to user
mode** performs one elevated-daemon stop followed by a normal daemon start.
Elevation is not stored as a toggle or sign-in preference because every approved
command and input action inherits the daemon's privilege.

**Consequences.** Relay-specific actions are discoverable from the corresponding
host without making global Settings wider. Routine CLI and support workflows no
longer require users to find paths or commands manually. Administrator state is
visible and reversible, while the management UI and automatic startup retain
normal user privilege. The product stays a thin CLI/TUI plus compact Windows
management surface; chat, plugins, voice, and terminal rendering remain outside
the tray.

## ADR 54 — Hermes Secure Link is pinned and service-isolated

**Status:** Accepted (2026-08-12).

**Context.** Tailscale Serve is the primary supported secure remote path today,
but some operators need encrypted Relay access without adding an external
reverse proxy or tailnet. Expanding a plugin-owned listener across API,
Dashboard, and Relay would collapse independent trust domains and expose
loopback-authorized management routes.

**Decision.** Keep Tailscale Serve WSS/HTTPS as the primary documented path.
Add an opt-in Relay plugin ingress, named **Hermes Secure Link**, on port `9443`
with fixed `/relay`, `/api`, and `/dashboard` namespaces. Pairing carries its exact HTTPS authority and SPKI
SHA-256 pin in the signed, operator-reviewed QR. Relay sessions, API bearer
authentication, and Dashboard cookie/native bearer authentication remain
independent. Dashboard forwarding fails closed unless its upstream
OAuth/password gate is active, so loopback-token HTML is never re-exported.

Clients require the QR-provided authority and pin before the first proxy
request, retain hostname verification, and fail closed on malformed, missing,
or changed trust. A rotation requires explicit re-pairing. Secure candidates
are ordered before LAN by default, while LAN remains an independently configured
fallback with its existing plaintext acknowledgement.

The three namespaces share one pinned TLS authority but not credentials: Relay
keeps pairing/session authentication, API keeps its bearer, and Dashboard keeps
its cookie/native bearer. Direct and Tailscale HTTPS routes remain independent
fallback candidates. Secure Link verifies continuity with the paired endpoint
and protects transport, but it does not establish the physical host's identity
or make the listener reachable across NAT or a firewall. Full invariants and acceptance checks live in
[`security-native-proxy.md`](security-native-proxy.md).

**Consequences.** Hermes Secure Link adds a narrow pinned-TLS option without
becoming a general host proxy or a second authentication system. Failure to
initialize it does not make the ordinary Relay unavailable or advertise a
candidate. Certificate rotation is explicit, and the vanilla upstream path
remains independent of the optional Relay plugin.

---

## ADR 55 — Outbound broker transport carries opaque Secure Link streams

**Status:** Experimental (2026-08-13).

**Context.** Hermes Secure Link encrypts an already reachable connection but
does not traverse NAT or firewalls. A native zero-configuration remote route
needs both host and client to connect outbound without giving a rendezvous
service access to Hermes credentials or payloads. It must also preserve
multi-device targeting and the direct, Tailscale, and LAN routes.

**Decision.** Add an optional outbound rendezvous candidate named **Hermes
Reach**. The client and host
connector use system-trusted WSS to reach the broker, which authenticates their
route credentials and matches an explicit opaque host identifier. The resulting
stream carries a second, inner TLS 1.3 connection to the host's existing Hermes
Secure Link listener. The client validates the exact authority and SPKI pin from
the operator-reviewed pairing QR. The broker and connector route bytes but do
not terminate inner TLS, parse Hermes protocols, or receive Relay/API/Dashboard
credentials.

Host and client broker credentials are separate. Initial client bootstrap is
short-lived and one-time; durable route access is scoped and independently
revocable. A host connection supports isolated simultaneous streams with
explicit framing, quotas, replay handling, and device targeting. Broker or pin
failure never downgrades to plaintext. Secure Link certificate rotation remains
an explicit re-pair. The detailed wire, threat, rotation, and acceptance
contract is [`security-broker-transport.md`](security-broker-transport.md).

**Consequences.** Hermes Reach remains an explicitly enabled experimental
fallback and must be ordered after Tailscale, public TLS, Direct Secure Link,
and other supported routes. It is not promoted in normal setup or marketing.
Hermes Reach can provide reachability while its broker can
observe connection
metadata, but a malicious or compromised broker can only deny, delay, replay,
or misroute ciphertext; inner TLS detects modification and wrong-host routing.
Hermes authorization remains local and the vanilla upstream path remains
independent. Implementing the client requires a TLS-over-broker byte-stream
adapter; advertising the candidate is forbidden until that adapter and the
cross-platform acceptance gates are complete.

## ADR 56 — Structured desktop control may use CUA Driver behind Hermes policy

**Status:** Accepted for phased implementation (2026-08-13).

**Implementation note (2026-08-13).** The first Windows integration keeps the
public `desktop_computer_*` contract and adds canonical runtime discovery,
manifest/version/tool/permission/health checks, an allowlisted CUA adapter,
server-owned control-session envelopes, per-session grants, sensitive-target
preflight, single-use snapshot tokens, pre/action/post snapshot flow, and local
CLI/UI engine status. CUA actions are background-only in this phase; foreground
escalation remains reserved and reports disabled. The optional driver is not
bundled or updated by Hermes-Relay, and Hermes forces driver telemetry off for
every child process it starts. The legacy engine remains the default and the
fail-closed fallback while the live Windows acceptance and remaining scope,
redaction, and grant-bridge hardening gates tracked in `docs/project/TODO.md` stay open.

**Second-phase refinement (2026-08-13).** CUA is the preferred/default setting
for new structured-control sessions; the original Windows input path is named
`legacy_compat` and remains available only as an explicit compatibility choice
or a fail-closed pre-session fallback when CUA is unavailable. The backend is
selected once per authenticated control session and cannot change mid-session.
Window-scoped snapshots/actions use CUA, while the existing read-only full-
display screenshot remains a separate `system_capture` path. Local audit and
the UI activity timeline expose bounded high-level fields—backend, dispatch,
control session, target app/window identifiers, action, phase, and verification
state—while omitting accessibility text, screenshots, entered values, and raw
driver responses.

Hermes now owns an explicit Windows lifecycle surface without bundling the
driver: `computer-use cua status|health|install|check-update|update`, with `--yes`
required for install/update. Mutations accept only supported upstream releases
(`>=0.19.3 <0.20.0`), verify the `trycua/cua` product/version manifest and
installer SHA-256 before running a temporary installer under a sanitized
environment, then verify the canonical `packages/current` binary, manifest,
version, path, and permission mode. Accessibility health is an explicit
diagnostic. There is no automatic install or
update.

**Context.** The first Windows input backend uses PowerShell, `SetCursorPos`,
`mouse_event`, and `SendKeys`. It can move the operator's physical pointer and
depends on foreground focus. CUA Driver provides target-process/window UI
Automation, accessibility snapshots, background input, and session-scoped
animated agent cursors without moving the physical pointer. Its full local tool
surface also includes foreground activation, arbitrary application control,
recording, configuration, and update operations that exceed Hermes-Relay's
screen/input capability.

**Decision.** Adopt CUA Driver only as an optional, version-pinned structured
computer-control backend behind the existing `desktop_computer_*` contract.
Hermes remains the outer authority for Relay authentication, target-device
routing, per-host capability policy, local grants, emergency stop, and audit.
The daemon translates an allowlisted Hermes schema to CUA operations; it never
forwards arbitrary CUA tool names or JSON.

Background dispatch is the default. A `background_unavailable` result returns
to the caller instead of silently foregrounding another application. Foreground
dispatch, application launch/termination, JavaScript execution, recording,
replay, configuration, and driver updates require separate, explicit local
authority. Full Access may bypass ordinary task prompts, but never authenticated
targeting, sensitive-surface blocks, UAC/session boundaries, audit, emergency
stop, runtime validation, or per-action failures.

Every semantic element action requires a fresh pre-action window snapshot, an
opaque element token bound to its snapshot generation, authenticated principal,
grant, PID, and window, followed by a post-action snapshot that records whether
the expected state changed. Grant scope and sensitive-surface policy apply to
both accessibility text and pixels.

Multiple animated pointers are virtual agent overlays, not additional Windows
hardware cursors. Relay must first attach a server-owned authenticated control
session identity—at minimum the Relay session, requester device, chat/run,
target device, and request—to each command. The desktop derives cursor identity
locally and owns one bounded CUA session per active control session. Model
arguments cannot choose or share cursor IDs. Grant expiry, cancellation,
disconnect, re-pair, policy downgrade, emergency stop, desktop lock/session
change, or daemon shutdown ends the corresponding driver session immediately.

CUA runs in the interactive user's logon session, never Windows Session 0.
Initial packaging remains optional and resolves the canonical installed package
rather than an untrusted PATH entry. Readiness uses the driver's live manifest,
schema, tool surface, daemon status, and permission mode and fails closed on an
absent or incompatible backend. Telemetry and driver updates remain explicit
operator choices.

**Temporary Windows implementation note (2026-08-14).** Until
`trycua/cua#3103` is fixed in the supported driver range, the whole-desktop
`health_report` is not a session-start gate: its fixed UIA timeout can report a
false degradation and leave the driver temporarily busy. Operators can re-run
that diagnostic from the CLI or UI. Structured actions retain their existing
target, grant, snapshot, timeout, and fail-closed checks. Remove this exception
when the upstream probe is bounded and cannot poison later actions.

**Consequences.** Hermes can gain background, element-aware control and clean
per-agent animated cursors without replacing its Relay protocol or permission
model. The existing PowerShell/User32 backend remains a compatibility fallback
until authenticated control-session identity, scoped grants, sensitive-surface
enforcement, and lifecycle tests ship. Raw command execution remains an honest
escape hatch: strong computer-control isolation is meaningful only when command
execution is disabled or the host is already fully trusted.

## ADR 57 — Official Desktop Relay UI is a lazy, unified-package runtime plugin

**Status:** Accepted (2026-08-14).

**Context.** Official Hermes Desktop now discovers a regular agent plugin's
`desktop/plugin.js` and loads it through `@hermes/plugin-sdk`. The SDK provides
profile-aware `ctx.rest()` access to the same `plugin_api.py` namespace used by
the web Dashboard, plus native pane, sidebar, status-bar, palette, close,
reveal, drag, dock, i18n, query, and unload lifecycles. Registering a pane also
adopts it into the live layout, which would violate Hermes-Relay's requirement
that plugin load and application lifecycle events never open or focus Relay.

**Decision.** Ship `plugin/desktop/plugin.js` beside `plugin.yaml` and the
existing Dashboard half. Keep the Desktop half opt-in and use only public SDK
imports. At registration time contribute three labeled open actions, but no
pane and no network work. The first explicit action registers one dismissible
management pane and calls the plugin-scoped `ctx.panes.reveal()` method.
Subsequent actions reveal the same pane. The host owns close, focus, drag,
docking, enable state, hot reload, and disposer execution.

The pane reads and mutates the existing Relay Dashboard backend through
`ctx.rest()` only. It maintains no server cache, starts no timer/socket/polling
loop, sends no notification, and makes no request until the user opens a view.
Every query key contains the active Desktop profile, while the SDK binds the
request to that profile's authenticated backend namespace. Pairing, revocation,
and remote-access actions stay user initiated; destructive or host-changing
actions require an additional in-pane confirmation.

**Security boundary.** Runtime Desktop plugins are trusted local ESM with full
renderer authority; upstream provides error isolation, not a sandbox. Relay
therefore ships fixed reviewed UI code only. It does not load generated ESM,
Kotlin, Python, remote modules, or arbitrary action schemas, and it never stores
tokens, keys, QR secrets, media paths, or duplicated Relay state. The existing
Relay-gated declarative Android Plugin Studio remains a separate host-rendered,
digest-approved capability model.

**Consequences.** One plugin install now exposes the Relay-specific management
role in both the web Dashboard and official Desktop without patching Hermes or
replacing the standalone Relay CLI/tray. The SDK has no public programmatic
pane-coordinate API and its agent `focus_pane` surface excludes contributed
IDs, so movement remains native drag/dock and agent-driven reveal remains
unsupported. Physical Desktop certification remains required for multi-window,
named-profile, remote/SSH-mapped profile, close/reopen, drag/dock, hot-reload,
and renderer-log behavior.

## ADR 58 — Android owns bounded cron creation and local reset evidence; connector prompts stay separate

**Status:** Accepted (2026-08-15).

**Context.** Three upstream-impact opportunities overlapped Android automation,
continuous-session diagnostics, and interactive cards. Current upstream source
provides `cron.manage` over the authenticated Dashboard Gateway and forwards an
optional positive `repeat` value to the existing cron store. It also provides
session-bound `clarify.respond`, `approval.respond`, `sudo.respond`, and
`secret.respond` RPCs with request identity and expiry. Separately, the NeMo
Relay connector defines gateway-to-gateway `prompt`, `prompt_response`, and
`react` operations whose clicking-user authorization and resolver ownership
belong to messaging connectors, not Dashboard clients. Upstream telemetry
session segmentation is opt-in server configuration and exposes no client
mutation contract.

**Decision.** Android Manage may create jobs directly with `cron.manage`. The
editor sends only name, schedule, task instructions, selected profile, and an
optional finite repeat count. Blank repeat preserves upstream schedule-kind
defaults. Explicit counts are limited to 1–999 and invalid input is rejected
locally because upstream normalizes zero or negative values to unlimited, which
would contradict the user's choice. Existing Dashboard HTTP routes remain the
list, runs, pause, resume, trigger, and delete surface; Hermes-Relay does not add
a scheduler or new Relay endpoint.

Before Android replaces a visible chat context for New chat or Thread entry, it
writes one bounded local checkpoint. The allowlist contains only the reset
reason, transport kind, structural counts, and boolean lifecycle state. It
contains no prompt/message text, IDs, profile names, URLs, paths, media, tool
arguments/results, credentials, or telemetry upload. The checkpoint uses the
existing app-private reliability ring and appears only in the user-reviewed
Diagnostics support bundle.

Android continues to resolve live Gateway asks through their native `*.respond`
RPCs. Connector prompt operations are not implemented in the app or Relay
plugin, and generic `CARD:{json}` actions remain display/send affordances rather
than approval resolvers. A future generic Dashboard prompt RPC can be evaluated
only if upstream publishes one with request ownership, authorization, expiry,
one-answer, reconnect, and replay semantics. Until then, copying connector
credentials, option IDs, or reaction routing into the phone would create a
second and weaker interaction protocol.

**Consequences.** Users can create recurring work that stops after a reviewed
number of runs on a current Gateway, while older or disconnected gateways fail
visibly without a fallback mutation. Reset diagnostics survive an app process
loss without retaining conversation content. Existing clarify multi-select,
free-text, expiry, reconnect, and one-answer behavior remains canonical, and the
connector-specific interactive-card evaluation is closed with no client
migration.

---

## ADR 59 — Android attachments use the upstream Gateway upload contract and fail closed

**Status:** Accepted (2026-08-15).

**Context.** Hermes exposes two unrelated media planes. Dashboard clients upload
user-authored images, PDFs, and files into one live Gateway session through
`image.attach_bytes`, `pdf.attach`, and `file.attach` before `prompt.submit`.
Separately, upstream gateway connectors exchange platform media by reference
through an authenticated `/relay/media` service and a capability-gated
`send_media` operation. Connector credentials and expiring references belong
to that gateway-to-connector boundary; they are not a mobile-client API.

Android previously treated any Gateway preflight failure alike. A document
upload rejected by an older host could therefore fall through to an API-server
SSE request that has no document channel. The local bubble still showed its
file card even though the agent never received the file. The picker also read
an entire provider stream before checking its configured size limit.

**Decision.** Android keeps outbound attachments on the authenticated upstream
Gateway contract. It establishes or resumes the exact stored session, uploads
each attachment in order, uses the server-returned `@file:` reference for
generic files, and submits only after every upload succeeds. The legacy dotted
image RPC remains the bounded compatibility fallback for older hosts. PDF or
generic-file method absence, upload interruption, missing file reference, or
an unconfirmed attachment-bearing submit fails the optimistic turn visibly;
it never changes transport and silently drops the file. Image/PDF paths staged
before a later attachment failure are detached best-effort. Queued messages use
the same immutable destination and upload sequence.

Picked content is base64-encoded through a bounded stream. The configured
client limit is enforced while reading, and the Gateway client independently
checks the decoded size against the upstream 25 MB image and 50 MB PDF limits
before creating a WebSocket frame.

The optional Hermes-Relay plugin continues to own only its existing
bearer-authenticated agent-to-phone `/media/*` surface. It does not proxy
outbound composer uploads, call upstream connector `/relay/media`, reuse
connector credentials, or duplicate connector-side processing.

**Consequences.** The transcript cannot claim a file was delivered when the
selected route omitted it, oversized providers cannot bypass the app's memory
bound, cold sessions upload only after their authoritative live identity is
known, and current hosts retain native image/PDF/file behavior. Older hosts
still accept images through the established compatibility RPC; unsupported
document capabilities produce an actionable retry/update failure instead of a
text-only turn.

---

## ADR 60 — Android resource and model-risk warnings follow upstream truth

**Status:** Accepted (2026-08-15).

**Context.** Current Hermes Dashboard status reports coarse memory and disk
pressure, including a suspected out-of-memory restart, while Gateway model
selection can require confirmation for unusually expensive or data-training
tiers. Android previously discarded the resource blocks and treated a
`confirm_required` model response as if the switch had succeeded. Recreating
either policy in the client would drift from Hermes and would misrepresent
older hosts.

**Decision.** Android parses only the optional public-safe `/api/status.memory`
and `/api/status.disk` fields supplied by Hermes. It renders a persistent
warning for the server classifications `elevated` or `critical`, and for the
server's `last_boot_suspected_oom` signal. It does not calculate thresholds,
sample the host, retain resource history, or emit telemetry. Missing, malformed,
unknown, or unreachable status fails soft to no resource warning.

Gateway model picks continue through the upstream profile/session-scoped
`config.set {key:"model"}` round trip. When its response carries
`confirm_required:true`, Android restores the prior picker state and displays
the exact `confirm_message`. Continue resends the same model/provider request
with `confirm_expensive_model:true`; Cancel performs no mutation. The pending
confirmation is bound to the exact profile and session and is discarded after
a context change. Older gateways that omit these fields keep the established
single-request behavior. API-fallback aliases remain unchanged because their
current upstream contract exposes no equivalent confirmation preflight.

This path includes Server default and a pick made on a sessionless draft. A
draft pick first materializes a profile-bound session using no raw `model` or
`provider` create fields, then performs the guarded `config.set`; failure to
obtain that session restores the prior selection. Ordinary `session.create`
also omits model/provider, and a new Gateway chat clears the prior session's
model pick, so no later send can reintroduce the unguarded create path.
For a named profile, the draft is retained only after the create result confirms
the exact `info.profile_name`; absent or different ownership fails before any
model mutation. The same confirmed draft can be reused by a superseding picker
revision, avoiding a second empty session or a wedged selection.

**Consequences.** Android warns before host pressure turns into lost chat or
failed persistence and before a confirmed Gateway selection changes cost or
data-use posture. Hermes remains the policy authority, Relay remains optional,
and no private host details, provider credentials, or client-maintained risk
table are introduced.

---

## ADR 61 — Android uses Hermes-owned profiles, static avatars, and animated pets

**Status:** Accepted (2026-08-15).

**Context.** Hermes Gateway now owns a bounded profile roster, explicit profile
creation semantics, compact `ui_meta`, and validated static avatar assets.
Android previously merged Relay/Dashboard rosters, created through Dashboard
HTTP, and displayed only phone-local icons or images copied from a Relay host.
Gateway has no profile-delete method.

**Decision.** On a current host Android capability-gates `profiles.list`,
`profiles.create`, `profiles.get_asset`, and `profiles.set_asset` independently.
The list call excludes session previews and becomes authoritative only after a
successful response; method-not-found stays sticky for that socket and leaves
the established Relay/Dashboard roster intact. Avatar fetches validate decoded
base64, declared MIME and size, PNG/JPEG/WebP magic, and the 2,000,000-byte cap.
They publish only while both connection identity and refresh generation still
match, so a late positive fetch cannot beat a newer `has_avatar:false` list.

Hermes-owned static avatars win at render time by default, but their cache and
the device-local `ProfileIconStore` use separate keys. A persisted, explicit
per-connection/profile phone override can make the local image win without
mutating Hermes. Phone selection and Relay host import populate that local
side; the shared picker and shared clear act directly on Hermes and never erase
the phone image. Animated GIF/WebP profile-icon decoding remains a local
override. Upstream animated mascots are instead consumed through profile-scoped
`pet.info`, `pet.gallery`, `pet.select`, and `pet.disable`; Android honors the
returned sprite geometry and revision cache contract. Pet archives, image
base64, and Sphere skins are forbidden from `ui_meta`; outbound
metadata is bounded to small preferences/references.

Profile creation serializes one reviewed auth choice: shared sign-in sends
`mirror_credentials:true, share_auth:true`; a copied snapshot sends true/false;
isolated sends false/false. Best-effort SOUL, model, environment, auth, and voice
results remain partial results in the UI. Dashboard create is an explicitly
enabled older-host fallback only for the legacy shared/default shape, never for
an explicit isolated request. Profile deletion remains authenticated Dashboard
`DELETE /api/profiles/{name}` until upstream publishes a Gateway contract.

**Consequences.** Static identity follows profiles across clients without
silently destroying existing phone or Relay-host choices. Older Gateways keep
their prior behavior, credentials never return to or enter Android logs, and
phone-local pet packs remain local. Physical two-client/avatar/pet and
shared-versus-isolated first-turn/voice certification remains required.

---

## ADR 62 — Android composer drafts are durable and large pastes stay reviewable

**Status:** Accepted (2026-08-17).

**Context.** Session-scoped drafts previously lived only in the process-owned
ViewModel. They survived navigation and Activity recreation, but process death
discarded them. Profile and connection switches could also clear the shared
pending-attachment list before the composer's key-change effect saved it. The
4,096-character default message limit rejected larger clipboard inserts before
the user could review or send them as files.

**Decision.** The composer remains keyed by stable connection, owning profile,
session, and draft slot. Its production store writes small JSON metadata plus
content-addressed attachment blobs under Android's app-private no-backup
directory. Writes run on IO, use replace-safe temporary files, retain at most
64 drafts and 128 MB of blobs outside the active draft, and collect unreferenced
blobs after send, removal, or pruning. Chat debounces ordinary edits, flushes
the latest snapshot on lifecycle stop, removes the active draft immediately
after a successful dispatch, and saves the previous owner before restoring a
session/profile/connection destination. Pending attachments are no longer
cleared by the profile-switch owner before that handoff.

A device-wide Chat setting, on by default, treats one insertion of at least
5,000 characters as pasted text. Android immediately replaces that insertion
with a loading `pasted-text.txt` card, prepares UTF-8/Base64 content off the UI
thread, and disables only submission until the attachment is ready. The
surrounding composer text remains editable. Gateway delivers the file through
upstream `file.attach`. Because vanilla API-server SSE and proactive Thread
transports have no generic-file channel, Android materializes this client-made
text attachment back into the outgoing text for those paths while retaining
ordinary supported attachments and their existing failure behavior.

**Consequences.** Closing or recreating the app no longer discards reviewed
composer work, navigation cannot rebind a draft or attachment to another agent,
and large structured pastes remain visible before send without making the
default path depend on Relay. Draft content stays local, is excluded from cloud
backup, is cleared on uninstall, and remains subject to the app's attachment
size limit.

## ADR 63 — Android Bridge authority is connection-scoped, grouped, and fail-closed

**Context.** The original Bridge safety contract had one persisted master
switch and one idle timer. Every command refreshed that timer, so a harmless
contacts or clipboard read kept screen-driving authority armed, while timer
expiry disabled harmless reads too. Command aliases, method-split clipboard
operations, raw intents, and Python-side composite tools also made a flat list
of UI command toggles easy to drift away from the actual executor surface.

**Threat model.** A valid Relay session or agent tool call may be mistaken,
prompt-injected, replayed after reconnect, routed to the wrong configured
Hermes connection, or upgraded while either endpoint runs an older version.
Android OS permission, AccessibilityService, MediaProjection, overlay
confirmation, target-package blocklist, and Relay channel grants are necessary
independent gates; none is evidence that the user granted a Bridge capability.

**Decision.** Android owns a closed `(HTTP method, path) -> capability` registry
at the first command boundary. Unknown routes and wrong methods return 403
before event reads, wake locks, confirmations, or executor calls. The master
switch overrides every capability. Policy is persisted by stable Android
Connection ID, and removing a connection removes its policy.

| Capability | Lifetime | Routes |
|---|---|---|
| Device/app info | Always/Never | current app, launcher apps (including `/apps` alias) |
| Contacts | Always/Never | contact search |
| Location | Always/Never | last-known location |
| Clipboard read | Always/Never | `GET /clipboard` |
| Clipboard write | Always/Never | `POST /clipboard` |
| Media control | Always/Never | play/pause/toggle/next/previous |
| Communications | Always/Never + per-action confirmation | call, send SMS |
| Outbound sharing | Always/Never + per-action confirmation | share media, compose MMS |
| Screen/UI inspection | Explicit lease | tree, nodes, hashes/diffs, events, screenshot |
| Screen/device control | Explicit lease | tap/type/gesture, keys, app navigation, raw intents/broadcasts |

`ping`, host-only `setup`, and bounded `wait` are operational primitives rather
than data authority. `android_navigate` and `android_macro` receive no composite
grant; each primitive route is checked. Notification history and shell remain
separate Notification Companion and terminal-channel contracts.
There is no read-SMS Bridge command in the audited inventory; adding one later
requires an explicit registry entry, capability decision, Android permission
review, status/docs update, and tests rather than inheriting Communications.

Screen leases offer 5 minutes, 30 minutes, or 2 hours of **idle** time. Active
screen commands refresh that timer, so there is no fixed wall-clock session
limit. A separately warned **Until turned off** choice has no idle expiry and
is intended for a dedicated/dummy device. It survives inactivity and reconnect
but still ends on End now, Master off, connection removal, or policy change.
Status reports this under `capabilities.unlimited`, not a fake expiry. Restart,
reconnect, master disable, manual revoke, and finite expiry cannot revive
revoked authority. Calls, SMS, sharing, and
MMS retain their on-device confirmation even when their capability is Always.
Android runtime permissions and MediaProjection consent are checked separately
at use time; the grant UI never claims to grant those OS authorities.

**Migration and compatibility.** Missing, malformed, or future policy schemas
mean no grants. Existing installs migrate with the master off and every
capability denied. The master moves to a v2 DataStore key while writes pin the
legacy key false, so downgrading to an APK that does not understand granular
policy fails closed. Capability policy is bound to a random install ID stored
under Android's no-backup directory, so a cloud or exported restore cannot
transfer authority to a destination install; restored connections must be
re-authorized. `bridge.status` adds only capability IDs and expiry timestamps; older
Relays cache and pass through the additive payload without interpreting it.

**UX rationale.** The main Bridge page is a cockpit, not the complete editor:
it keeps permanent and screen-access policy directly below Master, followed by
one authoritative Unattended Access card rather than a duplicate summary and
switch. It guides first setup through a preset or Custom and summarizes only
the Android prerequisites required by selected capabilities. Expanding Android
access preserves the full
permission matrix and Test/Settings actions; Safety preserves all granular
toggles, blocklists, confirmation vocabulary/timeouts, overlay setting, trusted
actions, and audit history. Screen access distinguishes renewable idle limits
from Until turned off, includes End now, and explains the dedicated-device
risk. Ending it clears unattended while permanent grants remain available.
This follows Android's guidance to
[request access in context and degrade gracefully](https://developer.android.com/training/permissions/requesting),
[minimize permission scope](https://developer.android.com/privacy-and-security/minimize-permission-requests),
and require fresh consent for each
[MediaProjection session](https://developer.android.com/media/grow/media-projection).
It also mirrors MCP authorization's
[least-privilege scope selection](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-11-25/basic/authorization)
without presenting Android app policy as OAuth scope.

## ADR 64 — Android settles missing Gateway terminal frames from authoritative session state

**Status:** Accepted (2026-08-20).

**Context.** A Gateway turn ordinarily ends with `message.complete`, but a
replacement WebSocket does not replay frames emitted while the prior socket was
detached. Current upstream still closes every accepted turn with a scoped
`session.info` carrying `running=false`, and `session.activate` returns the same
authoritative running state for the exact live runtime. Official Desktop uses
that idle state as its settle backstop when `message.complete` is absent. The
TUI owns one live session directly and also restores the returned running state;
API-server SSE has its own explicit `assistant.completed`, `run.completed`, and
`done` boundaries.

Android previously reactivated the exact live runtime after a mid-turn socket
loss but continued waiting only for the missing `message.complete`. The turn
watchdog, streaming placeholder, send queue, and Compose state therefore stayed
live even when upstream had already persisted the final answer. The earlier
visible-chat Idle reattach fix covered a socket that closed after foreground
prewarm; it did not cover this already-active turn state.

**Decision.** A Gateway turn may settle from `session.activate`, exact-session
`session.info`, or an exact live/durable `session.active_list` row only when the
turn is Android-owned, has already received turn-scoped activity, and upstream
reports `running=false` or Idle. The active-list request captures the exact turn
and its progress generation; a session/profile switch, cancellation, newer turn,
or intervening live event rejects the delayed snapshot. Pre-start idle snapshots
and passively observed Desktop/TUI turns are never eligible. This backstop is a
successful server-owned settle, not cancellation or transport failure: Android
completes the local stream, keeps the durable session identity, performs bounded
identity-fenced history reconciliation, consumes one late terminal without
double-completion, and never resubmits through API fallback. A locally queued
correction drains once through its existing owner chain after settlement. Cold
open continues to use `session.resume`; an authoritative resume rejection
remains visible and cannot create or switch to a replacement context.

The recovery writes one bounded content-free diagnostic containing only route,
missing-terminal phase, and reconciliation action. It records no prompt or
message text, credentials, hostnames, URLs, profile names, session identifiers,
or filesystem paths.

**Consequences.** Foreground-open and reconnected chats recover without leaving
the session, duplicate submission, wrong-session events, or an arbitrary timer.
Normal terminal delivery is unchanged, queued turns retain their existing
ownership, Relay remains optional, and unmodified upstream compatibility is
preserved. Physical certification across the reported device/network matrix
remains tracked in `docs/project/TODO.md`.

---

## ADR 65 — Gateway client contracts use reusable on-demand scenario fixtures

**Status:** Accepted (2026-08-21).

**Context.** Android, official Desktop, the TUI, and API fallback expose related
but non-identical chat lifecycles. Existing tests grew around individual event
mappers, client harnesses, and source markers. They proved many local behaviors
but did not provide one reusable scenario for a real socket gap, exact-session
activation, authoritative history, lifecycle-aware rendering, and physical
device evidence. Issue #365 crossed all of those boundaries.

**Decision.** Hermes-Relay keeps a client-neutral vanilla Gateway fixture with
real HTTP/WebSocket JSON-RPC and declarative scenarios. Scenario manifests may
declare current-upstream requirements; a separate non-provider source check
validates those requirements against a clean unmodified upstream checkout.
Android uses both a standalone real-socket instrumentation regression and an
external-fixture adapter built from production Gateway, ViewModel, handler,
main-looper, lifecycle, and Compose collection paths. A separate opt-in ADB
runner owns APK identity, port reversal, instrumentation execution, optional
app lifecycle smoke, and bounded privacy-safe evidence.

The lanes are manual and on demand. No cron, scheduled workflow, nightly run,
device farm, provider call, real conversation, or automatic radio mutation is
created. Device-wide radio changes require an explicit dry-run receipt and a
second exact confirmation. Relay-only routes, OAuth browser flows, Desktop/TUI
client adapters, hosted devices, and scheduled execution remain future work.

**Consequences.** Protocol regressions gain a deterministic cross-client
vocabulary while client-specific assertions remain with each client. Current
upstream drift, Android state-machine defects, rendered lifecycle failures, and
physical-device failures are reported as distinct evidence lanes. A physical
pass is never inferred from JVM or source checks, and scheduled execution can
be considered later without being silently introduced now.

---

## ADR 66 — Android Supervised Mode is a parent-controlled client policy

**Status:** Implemented in code; app-specific parent credential and physical managed-device certification pending (2026-08-31).

**Context.** Some operators prepare a deliberately restricted Hermes profile
for use through a parent-supervised Android client. The profile remains the
authority for its model, prompt, tools, provider credentials, content behavior,
and server-side data. Hermes-Relay should help a parent present a smaller,
proctored phone interface without representing that interface as end-to-end
child security or as a server-enforced account type.

**Decision.** Android will treat Supervised Mode as an opt-in, locally enforced
policy pinned to one existing Connection and one existing Hermes profile. The
parent is responsible for preparing and reviewing that profile before enabling
the mode. Entering, changing, or leaving the parent policy requires the
app-global parent PIN or password. Android's screen lock, device credential,
and enrolled biometrics are not parent authority because the supervised user
may legitimately control them. While the policy is active, the app restores directly
into a restricted root and never renders the ordinary app behind an
authentication prompt. A missing Connection, missing profile, malformed policy,
failed authentication, process restart, or restored route that cannot prove its
owner fails closed to the restricted surface.

The ordinary Chat screen stays visually quiet. It does not carry a persistent
"supervised" banner. Its existing Settings action opens only approved
preferences; a separate **Parent access** row authenticates before showing the
policy editor or full application settings. Backgrounding, inactivity, process
recreation, and leaving parent settings relock parent access according to the
policy. Deep links, notification actions, restored navigation, shortcuts, and
programmatic routes pass the same gate.

The parent credential store persists only salted verifiers in app-private
DataStore. Parent and recovery verifiers use independent 128-bit salts and
PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 with 310,000 iterations; candidate comparison is
constant-time. Five failures start a persisted 30-second delay, repeated
failures increase it to a capped 15 minutes, and successful verification clears
the counter. Enrollment first requires an explicit choice: an exactly six-digit
PIN entered through the app keypad, or a password of at least eight and at most
64 characters entered through the normal password keyboard. It returns a randomly
generated six-word recovery phrase exactly once. Six distinct words from a
128-word vocabulary provide about 42 bits of entropy: deliberately less than the
previous opaque code, but materially easier to read, type, and send for this
family-facing client restriction. Authenticated change and recovery
reset replace both verifiers and issue a new recovery phrase; unauthenticated
enrollment cannot overwrite an existing or corrupt record.

An authenticated parent may remove the app-global credential without presenting
the recovery phrase. Removal atomically deletes the credential record and sets
every supervised policy to `enabled = false`, so no policy can remain active
without an unlock path. All other policy configuration is retained for later
re-enrollment. It does not delete server-owned Hermes sessions or history. If both the parent
credential and recovery phrase are lost, the deliberate last-resort escape hatch
is Android's **Clear data** action for the app. Uninstall/reinstall is not the
documented recovery path because Android backup restore may restore local state.

Missing, malformed, unsupported-version, weakened-KDF, and unreadable records
fail closed. A legacy enabled policy has no trustworthy app parent identity to
migrate, so it stays at the restricted root. Recovery requires resetting local
app data, reconnecting, and configuring Supervised Mode again; Android must not
disable the policy or promote the current device user automatically. Server
sessions and history are not deleted by that local reset.

The parent policy controls capabilities rather than imposing a special
attachment count. Initial capabilities are text chat, new chat, cancel, steer,
attachments, standard voice, generated-media viewing, save/share media, copy,
retry, quote/reply, and edit/resend. Attachments and voice are independently
enabled. When attachments are enabled, Android retains the normal supported
attachment flow and its existing size/type limits unless the parent selects a
stricter limit; disabling attachments removes every picker, paste-to-file,
camera/share-to-chat, and restored-draft entry point. Disabling voice removes
capture, voice intents, and voice settings from the restricted surface. Provider
credentials remain on the configured Hermes host under the existing standard
voice contract.

The restricted composer does not expose the command palette, slash
autocomplete, server command catalog, or command-generated action cards. A
leading slash is rejected locally rather than dispatched; approved outcomes
such as New chat and Cancel remain explicit typed UI actions. Approval,
clarification, secret, and elevated-access requests are denied or skipped
immediately with a bounded notice. The supervised user cannot authorize them;
a parent may retry from the authenticated full client.

Restricted Settings contains only parent-approved, non-authoritative choices,
such as a supervised-only theme, text size, language, haptics, accessibility,
message presentation, sensitive-media blur, and permitted voice playback
preferences. Connections, Manage, profiles, models, personalities, reasoning,
approvals, tools, plugins, Terminal, TUI, Bridge, Device Control, notification
companion, diagnostics, logs, files, credentials, developer controls, Relay
management, and other sessions are absent rather than shown disabled.

The parent may allow the configured floating pet and may independently let the
supervised user change the phone-local profile icon or an already-installed chat
background. The parent retains those appearance controls when supervised-user
changes are disabled. Conversation history and its mutations are separate
permissions: pin, rename, archive/restore, transcript sharing, and delete are
individually allowlisted, while technical session identifiers and cross-profile
administration remain hidden. Delete retains its confirmation step.

The parent also chooses what Chat discloses. **Simple** is the default: agent
name/avatar plus generic Connected, Working, and Reconnecting states; it hides
model, profile, provider/route, context, token/usage, reasoning, and tool detail.
**Transparent** may add timestamps, bounded usage/context information, and
approved activity labels without exposing arguments, results, paths, or
credentials. **Custom** exposes the individual visibility switches. Model name
and profile name default off in every new policy. Required errors, safety
notices, parent-action states, and connection failures cannot be hidden by a
cosmetic visibility choice.

Session selection is limited to the pinned profile. New chat creates a new
conversation for that profile; history visibility, transcript retention, and
conversation actions follow the parent policy. Ending Supervised Mode may clear
local drafts, pending media, and restricted caches, but does not imply deletion
of server-owned session history. Server history remains available through the
parent's ordinary authenticated Hermes surfaces.

When the optional Relay plugin is paired, Android reports a bounded
client-declared `supervised` tag and a non-sensitive policy summary with its
ordinary device identity. Relay and its UI may display that tag and allow the
operator to revoke the paired Relay session through the existing revocation
model. The tag is informational: Relay does not interpret or enforce the Android
policy, pin a profile, filter Gateway traffic, or certify the client. Revoking
the Relay session removes Relay-backed capabilities but cannot revoke a direct
Dashboard/Gateway session or remotely disable an Android-only policy. Without
Relay pairing, Supervised Mode remains usable and locally enforced.

**Security and product boundary.** This mode restricts the official Android UI,
not the Hermes agent or server. It cannot secure another client, a modified APK,
direct server access, server-side tools, provider output, or a parent account
whose credentials are available elsewhere. It is not a substitute for profile
hardening, provider safety controls, parental review, operating-system controls,
or applicable legal obligations. Public language uses **Supervised Mode** or
**parent-controlled client**, not "child account," "safe for children," or
"server enforced."

The verifier design raises the cost of an offline guess but cannot make a
six-digit PIN high entropy. A privileged attacker who can copy or roll back the
app-private store can attempt guesses offline or weaken the persisted backoff;
device integrity, backup policy, and a strong parent password remain relevant.
The recovery phrase may be copied or shared with a brief instruction to remove
the message or saved copy from the phone after it reaches a parent-only place.
It must otherwise be stored outside the supervised user's reach. Stock
Android also cannot give one app a parent-only biometric enrollment or tell the
app which enrolled fingerprint or face authenticated. Biometric convenience may
be considered only as an explicit second layer over this app credential, never
as proof of a distinct parent.

**Localization decision.** Until physical certification and fluent security-copy
review, the Supervised Mode and parent-authentication surface remains canonical
English in every app locale. It intentionally falls back to English and must not
be described as localized. Security-critical setup, recovery, migration, and
lockout wording will move into the translated catalogs together after review;
machine-translating only part of this boundary is not accepted.

**Verification gate.** Implementation requires policy, authentication,
navigation, KDF-record validation, persisted throttling, change/recovery
rotation, corruption/migration, process-death, deep-link, notification, capability, attachment,
voice, session-ownership, Relay-tag, and revocation tests. Physical testing must
cover the exact Android build on a managed/restricted device, including relock,
restart, offline recovery, and attempts to escape the restricted root. Until
that evidence exists, documentation and release notes must call the feature
planned or experimental and must not call it child-ready.

**Consequences.** The project gains a generalized, low-noise supervised client
without creating a new Hermes account type or making Relay a chat authorization
proxy. Parents receive clear local controls and optional paired-device
visibility, while server ownership and the limits of client-side enforcement
remain explicit.

## ADR 67 — Android Bot Mode is a separate upstream-owned messaging workspace

**Status:** Accepted (2026-08-24).

**Context.** Upstream Hermes Desktop presents profiles as Bots with one durable
canonical `Bot Chat`, profile-scoped routines, group rooms, and source-qualified
multi-gateway ownership. Folding those rows into Android's ordinary session
drawer would mix a standing identity/room roster with scratch conversations and
repeat the category error avoided for platform Threads. Desktop also owns live
group orchestration locally while publishing a bounded recent-history projection
through Gateway `ui_meta` for other clients.

**Decision.** The existing drawer gains one `Bot Mode` entry and otherwise keeps
its session behavior. Bot Mode is a full-screen messenger list with gateway,
All/Bots/Groups, search, activity, individual Bot, and group-room affordances.
It aggregates every saved gateway with bounded concurrency and keeps the
foreground connection unchanged. Last-good rows remain visible as offline.
Upstream `install_id` collapses two saved routes to the same installation before
same-profile handle disambiguation.

Android consumes `profiles.list {include_sessions:true}` only for this surface.
The Gateway's `canonical_session` wins. When absent, Android performs the exact
hidden-title lookup for `Bot Chat`, fails closed on lookup error, and creates and
materializes a hidden canonical row only after authoritative absence. Opening it
uses the existing profile/session chat owner and exposes a direct return to Bot
Mode. `/new` and `/reset` in that canonical surface run the existing bounded
compression path instead of forking the relationship. New Bot creates an upstream profile with shared authentication and writes
only the small `hermes-bots` metadata marker; profile skills/model remain managed
through the established Hermes surfaces.

Every Bot owner is the immutable `(connectionId, profile)` pair. Both the active
Bot strip and conversation list use that pair for stable Compose item identity;
opening progress belongs to the same exact owner. Profile names, display labels,
and handles alone are not unique across installations. Upstream
[`profiles.list`](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/blob/2db0c7a2d8f29debe7d1cbfb4a72f4f98dc00808/tui_gateway/methods_profiles.py)
returns installation-local profile names and profile-local session summaries.
A typed route
pool holds separate clients for separate owners, validates bearer authority
against that connection's exact trusted Dashboard base, adds the profile to the
WebSocket URL, mints a fresh one-use ticket on every dial, and uses request or
retained leases so a stale release cannot evict a replacement. Opening a Bot
uses a dedicated Gateway-only Chat destination and Dashboard history reader;
it never switches the globally active connection or lets API fallback consult a
different database.

Group rooms parse the bounded v3 `hermes-bots-groups` projection without its
optional embedded image. They render read-only and cannot dispatch or mutate
room state. Android does not copy Desktop's round-robin coordinator or local
plugin store.

**Consequences.** Vanilla upstream owns Bot identity, history, auth, and prompt
protocol; Relay remains optional. Ordinary sessions remain legible, same-named
profiles on different gateways cannot alias, a remote Bot Chat cannot leak into
the active connection, and a group cannot gain a competing mobile writer.
Route-scoped Relay media, voice, background delivery notifications, autonomous
peer delivery, and writable room control remain separate capabilities rather
than implicit authority gained from appearing in the union roster.

## ADR 67 — Provider account usage is Relay-enhanced, normalized, and user-presented at top level

**Context.** Android had no account-limit surface even though current Hermes
already models Codex and Nous usage. A proposed OpenCode Go-only Settings card
introduced a Relay proxy, fixed provider windows, and inferred dollar spend
from rounded percentages. That shape could not represent multiple providers,
made changing plans look authoritative, and placed a provider-specific card on
the Settings landing page for hosts where it did not apply.

**Decision.** Android owns one top-level **Usage & limits** Settings destination,
parallel to Hermes Management rather than nested inside it. The device-level
landing presentation is Summary by default, with opt-in Expanded and Hidden
modes plus per-provider visibility. The full destination remains reachable in
all three modes.

When Dashboard auth is available, the client first calls the Relay-owned
Dashboard-plugin usage route so the live session's active credential can be
resolved directly. Paired standalone clients fall back to Relay
`GET /usage/providers`, which requires the operator to set
`RELAY_PROVIDER_USAGE_ENABLED=1`; additive upstream Gateway `account.usage`
remains the bounded single-account fallback. Relay reuses Hermes's existing
account model for Codex and Nous and supplies the missing OpenCode Go adapter. OpenCode Go
renders only the percentage and reset values returned by the provider; Android
does not infer dollars or embed plan caps. Provider keys stay host-side.
The active profile is carried on the compatibility request and validated before
Hermes's task-local home override scopes every account lookup, so concurrent
profiles never collapse onto the root account.

For Codex pools, Android also carries its current Gateway session id. The
authenticated Relay Dashboard-plugin route runs in the process that owns the
live agent, reads its authoritative stable pool-entry id on demand, and returns
the provider-neutral usage response without waiting for another turn. Relay
fetches each pool entry's usage host-side, returns safe labels and hashed opaque
ids, and marks the exact active entry. Turn hooks retain a secret-free
profile-local snapshot only for standalone Relay clients without Dashboard
access. Missing live-agent/session evidence is rendered as active unknown; it
is never inferred from the first credential or from the legacy singleton.

xAI and other providers remain absent until their account-level source and
credential scope can be represented honestly. Per-request or session spend is
not labeled as an account quota.

**Consequences.** Relay can evolve richer provider adapters without requiring
an upstream Hermes change, while vanilla/current Hermes retains a bounded
single-account fallback. Merely configuring a provider credential does not
expose tokens to paired devices. The Android UI can add providers without
adding provider-specific screens or silently treating missing data as zero usage.

---

## ADR 68 — Android session activity has one profile-scoped authority

**Status:** Accepted (2026-08-25).

**Context.** Dashboard and API-server session lists expose `is_active`, but
upstream defines it as an unended persisted row updated within the last five
minutes. It is useful recency metadata, not proof that a model turn is running.
Android nevertheless used it as a fallback for **Working**, while local
composer state, detached-turn checkpoints, pending requests, and drawer rows
each derived activity independently. A completed turn could therefore remain
Working, a restart could restore an unverified busy state, and an All Profiles
row could inherit another profile's live status through a bare session id.

Current upstream exposes live authority through the process-wide Gateway
`session.active_list`. It reports attachable in-memory runtimes as `starting`,
`working`, `waiting`, or `idle`, with both the live id and durable session key.
It accepts only an optional `current_session_id`; rows normally have no profile
metadata or filter. Exact pending-request events carry more specific
Needs-input ownership. Exact turn terminals and `session.info {running:false}`
can settle a matching generation. `process.list` is a different contract: a
background process may remain after its parent model turn is idle.

**Decision.** Android owns one composite activity registry keyed by stable
connection identity, normalized profile, and durable session id. Runtime ids
are aliases only within that owner. The same reducer drives drawer badges and
filters, visible composer state, animation, and accessibility.

The precedence is:

1. An exact pending approval, clarify, sudo, secret, or MCP request is **Needs input**.
2. A successfully resolved process-wide `session.active_list` row supplies
   **Starting**, **Working**, or **Idle** to its exact client-owned profile
   record. Waiting without an exact pending payload remains a conservative
   needs-input state until the request detail arrives or clears.
3. An exact terminal event, `session.info {running:false}`, or
   `session.activate {running:false}` settles only the matching runtime
   generation.
4. A matching `process.list` row may add **Background work** independently; it
   never keeps the conversation Working.
5. A checkpoint restored after process recreation is **Checking** until
   revalidated. A failed or unsupported live refresh is **Unavailable**.

Android resolves each active-list row through exact foreground or detached
ownership already held by that client, explicit profile metadata if a future
upstream sends it, or the currently selected passive session when its durable
`session_key` has exactly one owner in the current connection directory.
Duplicate same-id owners across profiles remain ambiguous and apply no status.
Resolved rows from a partial snapshot may update their exact owners, but they
cannot infer absence. A missing row clears stale live state for a scope only
when the successful process-wide snapshot was complete and every relevant row
was unambiguously resolved. A failed refresh does not settle anything. REST
`is_active`, `last_active`, and relative timestamps never influence execution
state. Old socket generations, late refreshes, and unscoped session ids cannot
revive a newer settled entry.

**Consequences.** Working and Needs input describe current upstream-owned
runtime state instead of recent persistence. All Profiles remains isolated,
restart recovery is honest about uncertainty, and background processes stay
visible without mislabeling their parent turn. Older Gateways remain usable
but show Unavailable when no exact local terminal truth exists. Declarative
Gateway scenarios cover all four upstream states, complete-snapshot
disappearance, client-side profile isolation, and method-not-found; physical
and current-host certification remains tracked in `docs/project/TODO.md`. An upstream
profile field/filter or explicitly owned aggregate activity route would remove
the remaining ambiguity for multi-profile clients.

---

## ADR 69 — Passive Android observation never attaches another client's Gateway turn

**Status:** Accepted (2026-08-28).

**Context.** `session.resume` and `session.activate` are live-runtime attachment
operations, not read-only subscriptions. Android previously called
`session.resume` while opening or foregrounding Chat and after loading a saved
session's history. When Desktop/TUI already owned a running turn, that passive
prewarm could rebind the runtime transport to Android. A later Android socket,
route, or client teardown could then strand the producer or promote the foreign
turn into an Android `GatewayTurn` whose cancellation sends `session.interrupt`.
The issue was distinct from the earlier stale-view and missing-terminal recovery
paths, which concern exact Android-owned checkpoints.

**Decision.** Ordinary visibility, foreground restoration, Idle-socket recovery,
and saved-session selection establish only the shared Gateway socket. They use
profile-scoped REST history plus process-wide `session.active_list`; while an
unowned row with the selected durable id is live, Android performs bounded
history refreshes and one final read after settlement. When that durable id has
exactly one owner in the current connection directory, the same read-only row
also projects Working or Waiting for the selected session; duplicate cross-profile
owners remain neutral. These observer paths send
no `session.resume`, `session.activate`, `prompt.submit`, or `session.interrupt`.
Exact Android-owned checkpoints retain `session.activate` with durable-resume
fallback, and explicit send or session-config actions may resume because the user
is intentionally taking control of that destination.

**Consequences.** Opening Android cannot replace, stop, or later cancel a turn
already running in Desktop/TUI. Live token frames remain with the producing
client; Android observes durable progress and final history without inventing a
multi-subscriber Gateway contract. The first explicit Android mutation may pay
the resume latency that passive prewarm previously hid. Cross-client fixtures
and Android lifecycle coverage enforce the no-control-RPC observation boundary.

## ADR 70 — Android session browsing is Dashboard-owned and latency-bounded

**Status:** Accepted (2026-08-29).

**Context.** Android had coupled the drawer's initial refresh to Gateway chat
readiness and expanded the request to a 200-row, multi-page read under an
eight-second deadline. On a large profile database, that read could time out
before returning any row. A fixed retry then repeated the same long operation,
so the drawer cycled through loading and a misleading empty or unavailable
presentation even though the authenticated Dashboard was reachable.

Upstream separates these concerns. Dashboard `/api/sessions/*` owns persisted,
profile-scoped directory and transcript state; `/api/ws` owns live chat and
Gateway runtime activity. The official Desktop session client starts from a
small recent window, gives list reads a dedicated budget, retains populated
rows during refresh, and rejects results whose request/profile activation is no
longer current.

**Decision.** On the standard Android path:

- The authenticated Dashboard REST route owns profile-scoped session browsing
  and stored transcript reads. Gateway socket readiness does not gate either
  operation. API-server session routes remain the compatibility fallback for
  API-only connections.
- A profile switch starts its session-directory read without first requesting
  `model.options`, profile configuration, or other agent-dependent Gateway
  state. The selected profile's declared model may seed presentation
  optimistically; `session.info` confirms an opened session and the model
  picker refreshes its catalog when the user opens it.
- A persisted named-profile token is sufficient to scope session REST and
  restore its Gateway last-session slot before profile metadata arrives. Cold
  start fetches only the lightweight server-default scope ahead of sessions;
  heavyweight `/api/profiles`, Gateway roster/avatar, pet, skills, and model
  metadata hydrate after the first exact-owner Dashboard directory success or
  when their explicit UI opens.
- When Android reattaches a stored session, Dashboard REST remains the display
  transcript owner. Its Gateway `session.resume` therefore requests
  `defer_history` and `omit_messages`, matching official Desktop: the runtime is
  registered promptly while Gateway hydrates model history off the RPC response
  path, without returning a duplicate transcript.
- Automatic cold-start or profile restoration does not begin that Gateway
  prewarm until a fresh session-directory result for the exact
  connection/profile owner has published. A failed or timed-out directory read
  leaves prewarm armed but inactive; a later successful retry may release it.
  Explicitly opening a session row remains immediate user intent and resumes
  after its REST transcript paints.
- Attaching an already-ready Gateway does not eagerly request command,
  reasoning, approval, personality, or model catalogs. Session browsing stays
  the cold-start critical path; `session.info`, completed-turn reconciliation,
  and the explicit settings/picker surfaces hydrate those control states.
- Optional Relay features do not join the cold-start critical path. Git
  repository discovery is off by default per saved connection, starts only
  while its workspace is open, and its blocking filesystem/Git work is
  dispatched away from the Dashboard event loop.
- A session-directory timeout remains bounded and does not start a timer retry
  loop. If Gateway later emits process-wide `sessions.changed`, that event is
  treated as a liveness edge and retries only an unavailable, idle directory
  request for the current exact owner.
- The full-screen startup sphere owns local-state restoration and route
  selection only. Once a route is selected, the mounted Chat shell shows the
  exact agent identity and animates inline Gateway/session progress; server wake
  cannot hide cached session rows or hold the whole app behind route narration.
- The initial drawer request asks for 50 recent rows after applying the user's
  hidden-source exclusions server-side. Near-end scrolling appends subsequent
  50-row `offset` pages under the same owner/generation; older rows never block
  the first-open critical path.
- Routine transcript open, restore, and post-turn reconciliation request one
  latest 500-row page, matching the rows Android can retain. Complete
  oldest-first pagination is reserved for positional recovery that proves it
  needs older anchors. Each Dashboard JSON response is rejected above the
  Android byte limit before parsing, and aggregate complete reads retain their
  independent row/payload ceilings.
- A refresh over existing rows is quiet. The exact connection/profile cache
  remains visible until authoritative replacement rows arrive. An uncached
  profile may show loading, but a failed read never means "no sessions."
- A session-read timeout ends the attempt and becomes retryable
  **Unavailable** without automatically starting another long read. A
  non-timeout route-readiness failure may retry only within a short bounded
  backoff before reaching the same state. This directory/history budget never
  applies to Gateway control calls: WebSocket ticket mint keeps its own shorter
  bound and may retry one transient transport failure with a fresh ticket.
- Every result is fenced by stable connection/profile ownership and a refresh
  generation. Profile switches cancel prior work, restore only the destination
  owner's cache, and reject late results from an old owner or generation.
- Dashboard status/auth and Gateway socket readiness remain separate. Dashboard
  success permits persisted REST surfaces; Gateway Chat becomes Ready only on
  `gateway.ready` from the current connection and route. Retryable cold-start
  transport failures use a bounded jittered budget, while terminal auth,
  unsupported, malformed-protocol, and access-policy failures stop reconnect.
- A failed progressive page stops automatic near-end loading and exposes an
  explicit retry; connection/profile changes reset offset, loading, and failure
  state before a new owner may request another page.

**Consequences.** Dashboard availability and Gateway chat availability can be
reported independently without split ownership of persisted session state.
Large stores no longer force a multi-page scan before the first row can render,
known rows do not disappear during background refresh, and genuine read
failures remain visible and manually retryable. Unit tests can prove request,
cache, and stale-publication invariants; physical-device timing against a real
large profile database remains a separate certification gate.

**References.** Official upstream behavior is recorded in
`hermes_cli/web_routers/sessions.py`, `apps/desktop/src/api/sessions.ts`,
`apps/desktop/src/store/layout.ts`, and
`apps/desktop/src/app/session/hooks/use-session-list-actions.ts`. Android wiring
lives in `DashboardApiClient`, `HermesRuntimeBinder`, `ChatScreen`, and
`ChatViewModel`.

## ADR 71 — Android conversations are transport-affine

**Status:** Accepted (2026-08-31).

**Context.** Standard Android Chat now follows the upstream Dashboard/Gateway
model, but Auto resolution still changed a live conversation to API-server
sessions, completions, or runs when Dashboard sign-in expired or Gateway became
unavailable. The optional API server could therefore make Chat appear connected
and even complete a local turn while Dashboard session/history reads returned
401. Gateway and API-server session ids belong to different databases and are
not interchangeable, especially for named profile homes. Reachability of one
surface is not authority to mutate a conversation owned by the other.

**Decision.** Every Android conversation binding includes its transport owner
alongside connection, profile, and session identity.

- A standard saved connection's Auto owner is Gateway and does not change with
  Gateway availability. `SignInRequired` requests Dashboard sign-in; a temporary
  failure preserves transcript, draft, attachments, queued destination, and
  retry state.
- Missing Gateway clients and failed Gateway preflight never dispatch the turn
  through API-server SSE. Attachments, voice sends, slash commands, queued
  turns, session restore, and profile switches all use the same bound owner.
- A legacy connection with API configuration but no persisted Dashboard route
  remains API-only. Existing `api_…` records retain their API session slot.
  Advanced manual Direct API selection is explicit and takes effect for a new
  chat; it does not migrate an existing Gateway transcript or session.
- Cold-start restoration selects the persisted session slot from the saved
  connection/manual preference, not a transient auth or health verdict.
  Dashboard history remains authoritative for Gateway bindings; API session
  history remains authoritative only for API-owned bindings.
- User-facing Connected and ordinary route labels describe the active binding
  owner. A reachable sibling endpoint cannot mask sign-out or failure. Exact
  endpoint names remain available in advanced diagnostics/compatibility UI.

**Consequences.** Sessions, runs, and completions remain useful for legitimate
API-only/headless clients, compatibility testing, and existing API records, but
they are no longer automatic recovery for standard Chat. Users retry or sign in
without losing local work, named profiles cannot cross databases silently, and
readiness reflects the conversation that will actually receive the next turn.

---

## ADR 72 — Plugin and CLI+UI release tags are approval-created

**Status:** Accepted (2026-09-01).

**Context.** Plugin and CLI+UI tag workflows correctly rejected stable tags
outside `main` and prerelease tags outside `dev`, but that validation occurred
only after an operator pushed the tag. The CLI+UI release recipe also told
operators to tag a prerelease from `main`, contradicting the canonical branch
contract. A rejected tag therefore left a failed check on an otherwise healthy
release commit and required destructive tag recovery before publication.

**Decision.** The normal Plugin and CLI+UI release path validates first and
creates the tag second. A single manual approval workflow:

- always runs the trusted workflow definition from `main`, then selects the
  exact `origin/main` tip for stable versions or `origin/dev` for prereleases;
- verifies the surface-owned version metadata and matching changelog heading;
- refuses an existing tag, then creates the exact `server-v*` or `desktop-v*`
  ref at the validated commit; and
- dispatches the trusted release workflow from `main`, whose jobs explicitly
  check out and revalidate that immutable tag.

Direct tag pushes remain a recovery path and retain the same fail-closed
metadata and branch-containment checks. Approval does not weaken release tests,
change stable/prerelease source branches, or combine the independently
versioned Plugin and CLI+UI artifacts.

**Consequences.** Routine releases cannot create a known-invalid tag before
discovering a branch mismatch. A tag created with `GITHUB_TOKEN` does not
recursively trigger Actions, so approval explicitly dispatches the release
workflow and the release workflow supports both tag-push and approved-dispatch
events. The workflow must exist on `main` before the approval surface is used.

## ADR 73 — Release promotion reuses immutable exact-tree evidence

**Status:** Accepted (2026-09-01).

**Context.** A coordinated release previously compiled Android up to four
times: local release verification, release-prep PR CI, private Play preflight,
and public tag publication. The canonical `dev` to `main` PR also repeated the
same path-aware matrix even when its synthetic merge produced the exact Git
tree already tested before integration. Rebuilding identical source increased
elapsed time without adding byte-level provenance.

**Decision.** Release evidence is content-addressed by Git tree and promoted
only through immutable GitHub Actions artifacts.

- Play preflight is the one stable Android signing/build authority. It stores
  the exact signed sideload APK, Play AAB, both R8 mappings, a manifest with
  version/commit/tree/size/hash metadata, and checksums for public assets.
- Stable Android publication downloads that artifact by immutable ID, verifies
  its successful trusted workflow run and full manifest, reruns package-level
  DEX/native checks, promotes the existing Play draft, and publishes the same
  APK/AAB bytes. Prerelease candidates retain their independent build path.
- Every successful Required-checks run stores a small tree-keyed proof after
  all selected jobs pass. A canonical `dev` to `main` PR may reuse it only when
  the simulated merge tree equals the `dev` tree exactly. Missing proof or any
  content change automatically runs the ordinary matrix.
- Local Android release iteration runs metadata and release-presentation tests;
  exact pushed commits still require CI and Play preflight.
- A coordinated approval workflow dispatches independently validated surface
  approvals concurrently; it does not combine tags or artifact contracts.
- Trusted desktop CI and the CLI+UI release workflow share a lockfile- and
  exact-source-keyed Rust/Tauri target cache. Release tags may restore the
  default branch's exact build state; cache misses retain the full build path.

**Consequences.** Stable Android bytes are built once, evidence reuse fails
closed on tree or hash drift, and release PRs avoid duplicate work without
weakening branch protection. Actions artifact retention becomes part of the
release window: expired evidence causes a safe rebuild/fallback, never an
approval bypass.

**Key files:**

- `.github/workflows/play-preflight-android.yml`
- `.github/workflows/release-android.yml`

## ADR 74 — Play voice overlay is independent of phone control

**Status:** Accepted (2026-09-12).

Voice Focus and a user-started voice-only system overlay are shared presentation
surfaces. `SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW` is special access, not permission to read or drive
other apps. Play retains the no-op voice bridge handler, unsupported Device Control
status, absent accessibility/projection services and closed bridge-command gate.

The overlay requires a resumed, unlocked Activity action and microphone,
notification and overlay access. Permission grants never start listening. Its
session identifier fences queued starts and old notification actions. The window
is attached only after microphone foreground promotion succeeds. The existing
voice runtime remains the sole microphone owner; no second recorder is created.

Stop/close, screen lock, task removal, permission loss and service/window failure
end the voice session. Returning to the Activity releases overlay protection only
after it resumes. The session is not persisted or restarted by background callers.
Existing independent opt-in wake/Assistant settings are not changed by overlay use.

Play's autonomous Accessibility Device Control boundary remains sideload-only.
User-mediated MediaProjection and phone compose/picker actions are separate future
features, not implicitly enabled by this decision. Standard voice remains upstream
Dashboard/Gateway-owned and never requires Relay. Google Play declaration, live
privacy/listing publication and physical-device certification are release gates,
not consequences of merging this change.

Source and merged-manifest validation enforce this boundary. Foreground-service
lifecycle tests and rendered permission/Stop controls supplement, but do not
replace, device tests or a reviewed Play test-track submission. See
[Play declarations](play-store-listing.md#voice-overlay-review-before-production).

## ADR 75 — Android "Always connect via Tailscale" is a per-connection client-side route lock

**Status:** Accepted (2026-09-26).

**Context.** Owners want a saved connection that reaches Hermes over the tailnet and
nothing else: when Tailscale is off, signed out, or the server is unreachable that way,
the connection must fail visibly instead of quietly falling through to a LAN, public, or
previously saved URL. Two requirements pull against each other — always connect over
Tailscale, and do not route the whole device. Today's Android behavior is the opposite of
fail-closed: ADR 24 picks the highest-priority reachable candidate and falls through, and
the app's Tailscale signal is informational only (`TailscaleDetector` matches a
`tailscale0` interface name plus CGNAT and `.ts.net` addresses). Two platform limits shape
any fix: a third-party app cannot identify the VPN owner as Tailscale, and the VPN
interface is a generic `tunN`, so an interface-name match is not evidence of the tailnet.

**Decision.** The mode is one opt-in boolean on the saved connection, enforced client-side
and per socket.

- `Connection.alwaysViaTailscale` (default `false`) is explicit per-connection consent;
  records saved before the field existed stay off. `TailnetEnforcer` holds the single live
  policy bit (`setPolicy(connectionId, enabled)`) and enforces only while that bit is on
  for the active connection.
- While the bit is on, route selection drops every non-tailnet candidate before ADR 24
  resolution: a `public` role, an `experimental` candidate, or any candidate whose
  dashboard/api/relay/proxy/broker surfaces are not all tailnet URLs is ineligible, and a
  candidate mixing one tailnet surface with one non-tailnet surface is rejected whole. The
  ADR 24 order of the survivors is unchanged.
- Non-tailnet dialing is refused rather than retried elsewhere. The effective Dashboard
  and API URLs, a freshly authenticated origin, and the relay/WebSocket path are each
  checked, and a refusal publishes one explicit blocked reason instead of a fallback.
- Enforcement is per socket and owned by one class, `TailnetEnforcer`. It hands every
  Hermes-host transport a bound `SocketFactory`, a tailnet-only `Dns`, and a network
  interceptor that rejects any connected peer outside the tailnet ranges. Binding and name
  resolution happen at dial time, so a client built while the mode was off obeys as soon
  as it turns on.
- Tailnet-ness comes from addresses, never from the interface name: MagicDNS `.ts.net`,
  IPv4 `100.64.0.0/10`, and IPv6 `fd7a:115c:a1e0::/48`. A network carries the tailnet iff
  it is VPN-transport and one of its link addresses is in those ranges. The `tailscale0`
  heuristic is gone.
- Every Hermes-host OkHttp client is built through `HermesClients`; the decorator is
  idempotent, so a client derived from a decorated one cannot install a second guard.
- Scope is "this app". The app binds only its own sockets. Keeping other apps out of the
  tunnel is the Tailscale app's own per-app split-tunnelling setting (include mode) and is
  the user's action; Relay can guide that setup and verify its own connection, but it
  cannot read or enforce another app's routing. That boundary is a platform limit, not an
  implementation choice.

**Alternatives rejected.**

- Process-wide `bindProcessToNetwork`: binding the process also sends updates, model
  downloads, images, LAN discovery, and loopback sign-in over the tailnet. Per-socket
  binding leaves those transports on their normal network.
- An in-app `VpnService`: a second VPN cannot coexist with the Tailscale app, and shipping
  one invites Play VPN-policy obligations the feature does not need.
- Embedding tsnet: a Go/gomobile runtime, a larger APK, and a second node identity that
  duplicates the installed Tailscale app.
- A server-emitted policy field: the pair/QR `endpoints` array is a top-level field inside
  the signed canonical body, so putting policy there changes the wire format and its HMAC —
  out of scope for a client-side switch.

**Consequences.** With the mode on, a connection reaches only Hermes hosts the tailnet can
reach: LAN discovery and non-Hermes hosts are unreachable while it is on unless the tailnet
serves them. Connections that did not opt in keep ADR 24's priority and fall-through, and
the mode never enables or disables itself. "Tailscale is off", "not signed in", and "this
app is excluded by split tunnelling" are indistinguishable to the app, so the blocked state
reports one reason and must not claim a specific diagnosis.

**Amended during implementation (independent review).** Turning the mode ON while a relay socket is
already live over a non-Tailscale route must not leave that socket carrying bytes: the resolver's
"`resolved == null && connected`" transient-miss early-return is a performance optimisation for the
mode-off case and does not apply while the mode is on, so the connection reaches the blocked state
(`PolicyNoEligibleRoute`) and the live socket is torn down instead of continuing over the LAN route the
user just excluded. Turning the mode on is therefore a fail-closed transition, not a preference hint.
