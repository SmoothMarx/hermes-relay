# Design QA

## Profile Shelf refinement

Status: **blocked**

### Compared

- Source: the selected compact Profile Shelf mock-up from the implementation task.
- Implementation: native Compose dimensions, theme tokens, and interaction semantics in `ProfileShelf.kt`.
- Target state: expanded shelf below the Chat app bar, Server default resolving to the active profile identity.

### Source-level review

- The shelf now shares Chat's base surface and uses only a subtle bottom divider.
- The selected profile uses a 44 dp neutral capsule inside a 48 dp interaction target, with a restrained accent outline.
- Profile artwork is 36 dp inside 48 dp targets; Server default keeps the resolved avatar and adds a small home badge.
- Overflow is pinned in a contained 40 dp visual surface inside its 48 dp target.
- Existing TalkBack labels, long-press actions, horizontal scrolling, switch gating, and full-switcher routing remain intact.

### Blocker

No ADB device is connected, so a real-dimension implementation capture cannot be compared with the selected mock-up. Source inspection and compiled tests do not substitute for visual device QA.

final result: blocked

## Agent Passport

Status: **passed**

### Compared

- Source: `<session-generated-reference>`
- Implementation: `<session-visualization-artifact>`
- Source size: 852 x 1846 px
- Device viewport: Android, 1080 x 2340 px, font scale 1.0
- State: Agent tab, Victor pinned profile, disconnected gateway

### Resolved findings

- **P2 - Header hierarchy and identity treatment differed from the selected concept.** The sheet now uses the Agent Passport title, large profile card, circular avatar, pin-style profile chip, status line, and four-column metrics strip.
- **P2 - Configuration controls lacked the concept's card hierarchy.** Personality, model, and reasoning are grouped into one outlined Active configuration card with matching icon medallions and row affordances.
- **P2 - Safety controls did not match the selected inline treatment.** Approval status, chat override, and fast tier now share one outlined Safety & speed card with compact segmented controls.
- **P2 - Primary action looked detached and visually unfinished.** Start new chat now uses the selected full-width purple-to-relay gradient, white outlined chat icon, and a single clean label.
- **P2 - Nested sheet and content gestures caused visible vertical bounce.** Sheet drag gestures are disabled for this scrollable detail surface and overscroll is suppressed; repeated device swipes keep the sheet anchored while the content scrolls.

### Final review

- Layout and hierarchy match the selected Agent Passport direction: profile identity, metrics, Agent/Session tabs, active configuration, safety and speed, primary chat action, and identity customization.
- Interactions remain wired: profile selection, configuration rows, Agent/Session tabs, approval and fast controls, new chat, and identity customization.
- Runtime values remain live rather than copied from the static concept; connection state, message count, route label, provider, and model can therefore differ from the reference.
- Native Android adaptation preserves system insets and scrollability on the taller 1080 x 2340 device viewport.

No open P0, P1, or P2 findings.

final result: passed

# Android Bot Mode messenger workspace

**Comparison target**

- Source visual truth: `docs/mockups/bot-mode/bot-mode-home-approved.png`
- Rendered implementation: `app/build/ui-evidence/bot-mode-home.png`
- Combined evidence: `app/build/ui-evidence/bot-mode-comparison.png`
- Viewport: Android Compose at `390dp x 844dp`, Robolectric qualifier `w390dp-h844dp-432dpi`
- Pixels and normalization: source `853 x 1844`; implementation `1053 x 2278` at Android density `2.7`. The combined evidence downsamples the implementation to `853 x 1844` and places it beside the source at equal visible bounds.
- State: dark Hermes Relay theme, active Hermes gateway, All filter, three active Bots, three Bot conversations, and two read-only group rooms.

**Findings**

- No actionable P0, P1, or P2 differences remain.
- Fonts and typography: the implementation uses the app's established Material typography and optical weights. The title, selector labels, active roster, conversation titles, metadata, and one-line previews preserve the source hierarchy without clipped primary labels.
- Spacing and layout rhythm: the implementation preserves the full-screen messenger composition, compact gateway selector, equal-width filters, horizontal active roster, divided chronological list, and one bottom-end primary action. Native touch targets make the selector and filters slightly taller than the generated source; all five rows remain visible at the target viewport.
- Colors and visual tokens: the first capture overused the strong electric `primaryContainer`. The final capture uses the softer theme-scoped relay/periwinkle tokens for selected and identity surfaces, graphite containers, semantic green presence, and restrained hairlines.
- Image quality and asset fidelity: production rows render the real cached upstream profile avatar when present. The deterministic fixture exercises the app's real initial fallback instead of shipping the mock's illustrative anime/crystal/robot images as product assets. Group rows use the app's Material group/lock icons; no placeholder bitmap or custom-drawn icon was introduced.
- Copy and content: Bot Mode, All gateways, All/Bots/Groups, Active now, source-qualified rows, previews, and Read only match the selected workflow. Relative timestamps follow the app's existing locale-aware convention rather than the mock's fixed clock values.
- Interaction: gateway selection, All/Bots/Groups filtering, Bot owner dispatch, group owner dispatch, search, New Bot, canonical Bot Chat open, read-only room detail, drawer entry, and Back to Bot Mode are wired. The fixture does not invent unread dots because current upstream supplies activity but no canonical mobile read-state contract.

**Comparison history**

1. Initial capture found P2 accent-weight drift: the selected tab, FAB, and fallback avatars used saturated electric fills; control borders were stronger than the source; an extra refresh action crowded the app bar.
2. Replaced large fills with the softer theme-scoped relay/electric-muted tokens, reduced control-border opacity and vertical padding, and removed the extra refresh action while retaining automatic load and error-state retry.
3. Re-rendered at the same `390dp x 844dp` state and normalized both artifacts into `bot-mode-comparison.png`. The corrected surface has no remaining P0/P1/P2 mismatch.
4. After multi-gateway aggregation landed, re-rendered the final All gateways state with per-row source-qualified handles. The gateway scope now matches the approved mock literally while preserving readable row density; no new P0/P1/P2 mismatch appeared.

**Open Questions**

- None blocking. A physical-device pass may refine P3 density at the user's font/display scale, but the deterministic supported viewport is complete.

**Implementation Checklist**

- [x] Keep Bot Mode outside the ordinary session taxonomy.
- [x] Match the approved list hierarchy and native return path.
- [x] Render a truthful all-gateway union without changing the foreground connection.
- [x] Render upstream group projection as visibly read-only.
- [x] Verify the primary filters and owner-routing interactions.
- [x] Capture and compare the actual Compose surface.

**Follow-up Polish**

- P3: physical-device review can tune handle truncation for unusually long gateway labels.
- P3: add canonical read-state dots only if upstream publishes a durable read-state contract.

final result: passed

## Assistant overlay

- Reference: `<session-generated-reference>`
- Implementation captures:
  - `<session-visualization-artifact>`
  - `<session-visualization-artifact>`
- Combined comparison: `<session-visualization-artifact>`
- Device viewport: 1080 × 2340, portrait, Samsung SM-S938U
- States reviewed: system assistant compact overlay and expanded overlay over a non-Hermes app

### Full comparison

The implementation preserves the selected progression: a wide bottom compact
bar over the current app, an in-place expanded assistant panel, and an explicit
Open full voice action. The current app remains visible behind both assistant
surfaces. The live expanded panel uses the existing Hermes theme rather than
copying the mock's illustrative app chrome.

### Focused comparison

- Compact: wide rounded bar, active voice orb, status/transcript, expand, and
  stop controls match the reference hierarchy.
- Expanded: drag handle, Hermes identity/status, waveform, transcript/response,
  Stop, collapse, and Open full voice match the reference hierarchy.
- Device review found the translucent expanded surface did not infer a readable
  content color for its title and collapse icon. The surface now explicitly
  uses the theme's `onSurface` color.

### Iteration history

1. Cold assistant activation initially proved the session could overlay another
   app without launching `MainActivity`.
2. Unlocked-device captures proved compact and expanded presentation over
   Reddit.
3. Combined reference/device review found and corrected the expanded foreground
   color inheritance defect.
4. A fresh final capture and full-voice handoff check remain pending because the
   device was locked after the corrected APK was installed.

final result: blocked

## Appearance customization and visual assets

- Selected reference: `<session-generated-reference>`
- Reference pixels: 852 x 1843.
- Final real-screen captures:
  - `app/build/store-shots/05_themes.png`
  - `app/build/store-shots/05_theme_customizer.png`
  - `app/build/store-shots/08_appearance.png`
- Implementation pixels: 1080 x 2160, portrait Robolectric/Roborazzi capture of the production Compose screen at its 360 dp Android viewport.
- Normalization: the selected reference was scaled to 1080 px wide and cropped to the same 2160 px viewport for the full-view comparison. The reference's taller aspect ratio remains visible as an expected viewport difference; the focused customizer capture verifies the below-fold editor content.
- Comparison evidence:
  - Initial full-view comparison: `<session-visualization-artifact>`
  - Final normalized full-view comparison: `<session-visualization-artifact>`
  - Focused customizer comparison: `<session-visualization-artifact>`
- State: Hermes Relay dark preset, customizer expanded. The focused capture expands the real control by click and scrolls its Shape row into view.

### Comparison history

- Iteration 1, blocked: the prior implementation was a card-heavy settings adaptation. Its preview was cropped and incomplete, presets sat inside an oversized explanatory card, mode and customization were disconnected containers, Shape was omitted, and Apply/Cancel were not anchored. These were P1 fidelity defects.
- Iteration 2: replaced the top section with the mockup's composition: compact header/reset, contextual conversation preview, four-card preset rail, inline mode selector, integrated customizer, and fixed preview/apply bar. The preview now uses the real app mark and Sphere renderer rather than placeholder assets.
- Iteration 3: normalized the 360 dp layout so all four preset cards remain visible, matched the six-color accent row, added the message gradient/timestamps/delivery state/tool metadata, and made Soft/Balanced/Sharp control the persisted Material shape system.

### Required fidelity surfaces

- **Typography:** current app typography is retained, with compact preview-specific optical sizes to match the reference hierarchy at 360 dp. The reference was authored at a wider/taller logical viewport, so line wrapping differs slightly without changing hierarchy.
- **Spacing/layout:** region order, proportions, four-up preset rail, compact mode row, integrated editor, and anchored actions now match. On the shorter 2160 px capture, the editor body scrolls beneath the fixed action bar; the focused capture verifies it rather than compressing controls below accessible sizes.
- **Colors/tokens:** deep neutral surfaces, violet selection, gradient user bubble, semantic green status, and six reference-aligned accent choices are mapped through the live Hermes palette.
- **Image quality/assets:** the production splash mark and live Sphere renderer are used. No raster placeholders, emoji assets, or approximated logos remain.
- **Copy/content:** preview prompt, times, response, tool/token metadata, composer, gateway/profile status, preset labels, shape labels, and Apply/Cancel/Reset actions follow the selected reference.
- **Background/pet split:** the lower capture confirms that background animation import and Sphere skin import remain separate from floating-pet roaming and placement.

### Verification

- Focused accent, shape persistence, background migration/selection, importer, and guide tests passed (14 tests).
- Sideload Kotlin compilation passed as part of the focused suite.
- Top, clicked/expanded customizer, and background-import production-screen captures rendered successfully and were inspected at full resolution.

No open P0, P1, or P2 findings.

final result: passed

## Conversation voice dock

- Reference: `<session-generated-reference>`
- Implementation captures:
  - `<session-visualization-artifact>`
  - `<session-visualization-artifact>`
  - `<session-visualization-artifact>`
- Combined comparison: `<session-visualization-artifact>`
- Expanded before/after comparison: `<session-visualization-artifact>`
- Entry transition recording: `<session-visualization-artifact>`
- Entry transition frame sequence: `<session-visualization-artifact>`
- Reference size: 853 x 1844 px
- Device viewport: 1080 x 2340, portrait, Samsung SM-S938U
- States reviewed: collapsed idle dock, expanded Tap-mode controls, collapsed and expanded Focus header, Focus-to-Conversation transition

### Full comparison

The implementation preserves the selected hierarchy inside the existing native
chat screen: voice state and waveform at left, one centered stateful microphone,
Focus and expansion at right, and the regular message composer immediately below.
Runtime chat history and the app header intentionally remain live rather than
copying the mockup's illustrative content.

### Focused comparison

- The conversation state no longer retains the focus-mode top session pill.
- The dock and text composer share one rounded surface and one microphone owner.
- The 52 dp mic remains the dominant action without obscuring model or reasoning controls.
- Expanded Tap, Hold, Auto, route, profile, Overlay, Exit, and Settings controls open above the dock and remain readable without truncation.
- Device review found the compact waveform painting beyond its assigned width and touching the Ready label. Compact bar geometry now fits a dedicated 40 dp lane with a visible gap before status text.
- Expanded review found disconnected metadata pills and excess vertical space. Both modes now use one two-line voice-route summary with a compact secondary-action row.
- Focus review found the animated avatar drawing above the expanded header and obscuring controls. The focus header now owns the foreground z-order, and its collapsed identity text is split into two readable lines.
- Voice entry always starts in Conversation presentation, including when Focus was the persisted preference. The composer expands upward over 240 ms with a coordinated fade, the mic remains anchored, and device frame review found no Focus overlay flash or clipped controls.

### Iteration history

1. Installed the selected implementation and verified the Focus-to-Conversation transition on the connected phone.
2. Captured collapsed and expanded conversation states at the production device viewport.
3. Corrected the waveform/status collision identified during live review.
4. Rebuilt, reinstalled, and captured the corrected idle and expanded states.
5. Compared the reference and final device capture together at normalized dimensions.
6. Compared the original and refined expanded Conversation and Focus states together; the final panels remove metadata fragmentation, header truncation, and avatar bleed-through.
7. Recorded a persisted-Focus voice entry, inspected the 30 fps frame sequence, and verified that Conversation appears first through a continuous composer expansion before Focus is offered as an explicit action.
8. Re-audited the installed Standard-mode drawer in both presentations. The final Conversation and Focus captures are:
   - `<session-visualization-artifact>`
   - `<session-visualization-artifact>`
   The route summary is now two clearly separated lines (`Standard mode · Victor` and `xAI TTS · Leo`), with duplicate provider/model aliases removed and configuration provenance left to Voice Settings.
9. Verified the Conversation long-press menu on-device in `22-final-speak-menu.png`: completed assistant messages expose Copy, Quote in reply, and Speak response without stacking Android's text-selection toolbar over the app menu.
10. Verified the connection footer remains present under the Conversation composer. Focus remains the only in-app voice presentation that hides it.
11. Attachment-state unit coverage now distinguishes a real image from PDF/generic files, using Attachment ready as the non-image fallback.

No open P0, P1, or P2 findings.

final result: passed

## System voice overlay redesign

- Selected reference: `<session-generated-reference>`
- Source concepts:
  - `<session-generated-reference>`
  - `<session-generated-reference>`
- Baseline captures:
  - `<session-visualization-artifact>`
  - `<session-visualization-artifact>`
- Device viewport: 1080 x 2340, portrait, Samsung SM-S938U
- States to review: collapsed system overlay and expanded system overlay over a non-Hermes app

### Implemented direction

- One stable rounded surface and header remain mounted in both states.
- Only the expansion body clips and fades, using a short 160 ms reveal instead of animating the full card with a spring.
- Waveform, transcript, response, route detail, and actions share one flat hierarchy separated only by hairlines.
- Standard-mode route data uses readable labels and removes duplicate provider/model aliases.
- Minimize, Hide, Open Hermes, microphone control, and Exit remain wired.

### Pending visual QA

Final same-viewport implementation captures and a combined reference/implementation comparison require user-positioned device states. UI review is intentionally user-driven.

final result: blocked

# Custom theme preset workshop


**Comparison target**

- Source visual truth: `app/build/ui-evidence/custom-theme-preset-workshop-reference.png`
- Rendered implementation: `app/build/ui-evidence/custom-theme-preset-workshop.png`
- Focused interaction evidence: `app/build/ui-evidence/custom-theme-preset-workshop-menu.png` and `app/build/ui-evidence/custom-theme-preset-workshop-style.png`
- Combined evidence: `app/build/ui-evidence/custom-theme-preset-workshop-comparison.png` and `app/build/ui-evidence/custom-theme-preset-workshop-focused-comparison.png`
- Viewport: Android Compose at `390dp x 844dp`, Robolectric qualifier `w390dp-h844dp-432dpi`
- Pixels and normalization: source `852 x 1846`; implementation captures `1053 x 2278` at Android density `2.7`. Comparisons downsample the implementation to `852 x 1846` so both panels have the same visible bounds. The generated source is a conceptual phone mock rather than a CSS viewport, so no CSS pixel size or device-scale factor applies to it.
- State: Aurora selected, Dark selected with Light available and Auto disabled, Balanced shape, visible name editor, and four editable color roles. The full-view implementation capture keeps the preset menu closed for a stable top-of-screen comparison; the focused capture proves the open overflow menu and the scrolled mode/shape state separately.

**Findings**

- No actionable P0, P1, or P2 differences remain.
- The implementation preserves the selected direction: a dedicated Custom screen, saved preset rail, directly editable name, live preview, Colors/Style tabs, direct color-role editing, selectable Light/Dark ownership, shape selection, and persistent Revert/Save actions.
- Fonts and typography: the implementation intentionally uses Hermes' existing Material typography instead of the mock's denser generated type. Preset labels use `labelMedium` and now fit Aurora while allowing Terminal Green and Warm Mono to wrap to two readable lines.
- Spacing and layout rhythm: the native screen scrolls rather than shrinking type or touch targets to fit every control above the fold. The partially visible Add card is an intentional horizontal-scroll affordance. Sticky actions remain visible.
- Colors and visual tokens: the rendered Aurora roles match the source values (`#0B0B0F`, `#141421`, `#5B6CFF`, `#F5F6F7`), with app-native semantic derivation for secondary roles and a visible WCAG AA contrast result.
- Image quality and asset fidelity: the target contains no photographic, illustrative, or brand-image assets. The implementation uses the app's Material icon set and real message-bubble components; no placeholder or handcrafted image substitutes are present.
- Copy and content: labels and saved-preset actions match the selected workflow. Preview copy is shortened to keep the native preview representative without duplicating the mock's synthetic agent/tool transcript.

**Comparison history**

1. Initial comparison found a P2 label-density issue: `90dp` preset cards forced Aurora to wrap and over-truncated Terminal Green.
2. Fixed by widening preset cards to `104dp`, using the established `labelMedium` type, and retaining horizontal scrolling.
3. Post-fix evidence in `custom-theme-preset-workshop-comparison.png` shows readable two-line maximum labels and the intended rail rhythm. No P0/P1/P2 issue remains.
4. Usability follow-up moved Custom to the first gallery position, exposed Theme name in the editor, and enabled Light/Dark selection while leaving unsupported Auto visibly locked. Updated `05_themes.png`, `custom-theme-preset-workshop.png`, and `custom-theme-preset-workshop-style.png` verify the integrated states.

**Open Questions**

- None blocking. The mock displays all editor sections simultaneously; the implementation deliberately requires vertical scrolling to preserve established font sizes, 44dp controls, and accessibility.

**Implementation Checklist**

- [x] Match the selected preset-workshop information architecture.
- [x] Keep live preview and color editing functional.
- [x] Render unsupported theme modes as visibly and semantically disabled.
- [x] Preserve sticky actions and accessible control sizes.
- [x] Verify preset menu, mode, shape, and save-state interactions with Compose tests.

**Follow-up Polish**

- P3: physical-device review can confirm whether the horizontal Add-card peek is discoverable at the user's actual font and display scales.

final result: passed

# Android Bot Mode messenger — P0 probes

Dated 2026-09-27. The P0 phase answers three questions before any messenger surface is built and leaves no
shipped code. Answers are recorded here as measured facts.

## T0.1 — conversation id namespace: stored id vs compression-lineage tip

**Question.** Does `GET /api/sessions` return the stored session id for every row, or can a row carry a
compression-lineage tip?

**Answer.** The directory row `id` **is the lineage tip**, not the stored id. The stored id is still on the
row, but only as `_lineage_root_id`, next to the whole chain in `_lineage_ids` and
`continuation_kind = "compression"`.

**Mechanism.** `hermes_cli/web_routers/sessions.py::get_sessions` lists through
`SessionDB.list_sessions_rich(...)`; that call's default `project_compression_tips=True` replaces the surfaced
fields of a compression-ended row — `id` and `title` included — with its live tip
(`hermes_state_sessions.py::_project_compression_tips`). The canonical Bot Chat path uses the other namespace:
`session.list` with a `title` returns the registry row as `id` and the tip separately as `resolved_id`
(`tui_gateway/methods_session.py::_session_list_by_title`), which the app carries as
`BotChatTarget(storedSessionId, resolvedSessionId)`.

**Measurement.** Read-only listing against a live host's session store, through the same function and the same
scope the REST handler passes (`archived=exclude`, `order=recent`, `min_messages=1`, `compact_rows=True`,
`include_pinned=True`); the handler's own auto-archive precondition was deliberately not exercised because it
is a write on a GET path. A 100-row window returned 102 rows, 41 of them carrying
`continuation_kind = "compression"`. Across those 41 rows: `id` equalled the chain tip (41/41),
`_lineage_root_id` equalled the chain root (41/41), `id` differed from `_lineage_root_id` (41/41), and the root
row was still present in the store (41/41). Observed chain lengths: 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 14, 15, 34, 44, 75
and 101. One sampled row had `id` equal to its chain tip, `_lineage_root_id` equal to its chain root, and
`get_compression_tip(root) == id`.

**Consequence for the plan.** The sequencing branch condition in the plan resolves to the tip-equality branch:
the conversation tab's selection matches the directory `id` (a tip) first, and the stored id is only a
secondary badge key. The surface can obtain the stored id only by decoding `_lineage_root_id`: the client
decodes with `ignoreUnknownKeys = true` and `SessionItem` carries no field for it, so today the stored id is
not represented on the surface at all.

## T0.1 — adjacent measurement: the directory read cannot see a hidden conversation

Every profile store examined carries its canonical "Bot Chat" row with `hidden = 1`. The session-list handler
filters `s.hidden = 0` and exposes no `include_hidden` parameter at all, and the API server's session listing
honours `include_hidden` only when a `title` filter is present — a blanket hidden listing is deliberately kept
off that surface. The directory read the messenger surface would perform therefore never contains the
conversation the Bot Mode route opens. Measured across three profile stores: the canonical row
was absent from the default window in all three, and appeared only in a direct listing with `include_hidden`
enabled (one of those also fails the client's hard-coded `min_messages=1`, because its row holds no messages).

Recorded as a measurement, not a change of shape: a decision is still needed on how the conversation sub-menu
and the tab strip obtain the row of a hidden canonical conversation.

## T0.2, T0.3 — pending

Not answered in this pass.

final result: pending
