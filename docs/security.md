# Security

## Overview

Hermes-Relay gives a remote AI agent full control of an Android device via AccessibilityService. This is powerful and inherently sensitive — treat it with the same caution as remote desktop access.

### Device Control is a build-flavor boundary

AccessibilityService-backed Device Control (screen reading, taps, typing, screenshots, overlays, unattended control) and the Tier-C `android_*` tools (call, SMS, contacts, location) ship **only in the `sideload` flavor**. The conservative `googlePlay` flavor is "Bridge Core" — relay pairing, chat, voice, terminal, notification companion, media, and session grants — and does **not** compile in any phone-control surface; gated routes fail closed with a structured `403` (`error_code: device_control_sideload_only` for Device Control commands, `sideload_only` for the Tier-C `android_*` tools) rather than acting. This flavor gate is the most conservative security boundary in the app: on a `googlePlay` build the capability is absent, not merely disabled, regardless of pairing or server configuration. It is orthogonal to relay pairing — pairing a relay on a `googlePlay` build still cannot tap or type. See `BuildFlavor` in `data/FeatureFlags.kt` and the capability matrix in `docs/path-architecture.html`.

## Current Security Model

### Authentication
- **Pairing code**: A random 6-character alphanumeric code. For the QR-driven flow, the pair command (`hermes pair`, `/hermes-relay-pair`, or compatibility `hermes-pair`) generates the code on the Hermes host and pre-registers it with the relay via the loopback-only `POST /pairing/register` endpoint; the phone-side `AuthManager.generatePairingCode()` generator is retained for the Phase 3 bridge flow.
- The phone and server must share this code to establish a connection.
- Codes use the full `A-Z / 0-9` alphabet (36 chars). The earlier "no ambiguous 0/O/1/I" restriction was dropped when the pairing flow moved from "human retypes code from display" to "code flows phone ↔ server via QR + HTTP" (see `docs/decisions.md` §6a).
- `POST /pairing/register` is gated to loopback callers only (`127.0.0.1` / `::1`) — only a process with host shell access on the relay machine can inject pairing codes. A LAN attacker cannot.
- Relay session tokens carry per-channel grants. Voice routes require explicit `voice:config`, `voice:stt`, `voice:tts`, or `voice:realtime` grants when called with a Relay session token.
- Remote `POST /relay/model-capabilities` calls require a valid Relay session
  bearer with an active `chat` grant. Loopback host-operator calls may omit the
  bearer. Hermes API bearer tokens are not accepted on this route.
- `/voice/config`, `/voice/transcribe`, `/voice/synthesize`, `/voice/output/*`, and `/voice/realtime/*` may also accept the Hermes API bearer token used by API-server clients. The Android app uses this fallback for chat+voice-only setups when no Relay session is paired. This is a narrow exception for chat/media-adjacent voice features only; the API bearer token is not accepted for sessions, media, clipboard, terminal, TUI, bridge, profile writes, or Android control routes.
- Hermes API bearer use on voice routes requires HTTPS for non-loopback callers by default. Loopback plaintext is allowed for local clients; reverse-proxy TLS is accepted only when `RELAY_TRUST_PROXY_HEADERS=1`, and plaintext LAN testing requires an explicit opt-in. Use `hermes relay insecure-api-key on` for a running relay, or `RELAY_ALLOW_INSECURE_API_BEARER=1` at startup.

### Rate Limiting
- Failed WebSocket authentication attempts are rate-limited per IP
- After 5 failed attempts in 60 seconds, the IP is blocked for 5 minutes
- Blocked IPs receive HTTP 429

### Connection Architecture
- The phone connects **out** to the server (NAT-friendly)
- The server relay only accepts one phone at a time
- All tool commands are proxied through the relay — the phone is never directly exposed

### Model capability discovery

The optional model-capability route accepts 1–64 validated provider/model pairs
and a bounded profile name. Resolution is isolated to that profile's config and
credential scope. Dynamic provider checks use short timeouts and a shared
four-request concurrency ceiling; results are cached for five minutes. An
explicit refresh advances a profile generation so an older in-flight request
cannot restore stale cache entries.

Provider credentials are loaded and used only on the Hermes host. The response
contains capability metadata and diagnostic source labels, never credentials,
credential fingerprints, provider response bodies, or internal cache keys.
Unsupported providers and probe failures return non-exact advisory metadata
instead of expanding authority or preventing chat.

## Known Limitations

### Plaintext `ws://` legs are possible
The relay can run without TLS (`hermes relay start --no-ssl`), in which case connections use `ws://` (plaintext) instead of `wss://` (TLS). On a plaintext leg:
- Commands, screen content, and screenshots travel unencrypted
- Anyone on the network path between phone and server can intercept traffic

The clients do not accept this silently: each pairing candidate carries a `transport_hint`, and the Android app keeps plain `ws://` disabled until the operator turns on "Allow plain (unencrypted) connections" and acknowledges the one-time warning dialog. TLS connections get trust-on-first-use SPKI certificate pinning on both the Android app and the desktop CLI.
- **Mitigation**: Use plaintext only on a trusted network, or front the relay with Tailscale (`hermes-relay-tailscale enable`) or a TLS reverse proxy (nginx/caddy)

Hermes API bearer tokens on `/voice/*` are stricter than the legacy WebSocket path: non-loopback API-bearer requests are rejected unless the request is HTTPS, comes through a trusted HTTPS reverse-proxy signal, or the operator has explicitly enabled the insecure dev escape hatch with `hermes relay insecure-api-key on` or the startup env var.

### Broad device access once Device Control is enabled
On a `sideload` build with Bridge enabled, the agent can:
- Read all screen content (any app)
- Tap, type, swipe anywhere
- Open any app
- Take screenshots
- Read installed app list

This access is fenced by several shipped rails rather than a per-app Android permission model:
- **Per-channel grants with TTLs** on the relay session token — bridge access can be excluded or time-boxed at pair time and revoked from any client.
- **Bridge safety rails** (`BridgeSafetyManager`): a per-app blocklist, destructive-verb confirmation prompts (fail-closed on `/call` and `/send_sms`), and an auto-disable timer.
- **Master toggle + status overlay** so control is visible and can be cut instantly on the phone.

The rails are deny-lists and confirmations, not sandboxing — a permissive configuration still exposes sensitive apps.
- **Mitigation**: Only pair with trusted Hermes instances, keep the blocklist populated, and disconnect (or let auto-disable fire) when not in use.

### Command audit is local, not centralized
The Bridge screen keeps an on-device activity log of executed device-control commands, and the relay logs commands to its service log at INFO level. There is no centralized, tamper-evident audit trail across surfaces.
- **Mitigation**: Review the Bridge activity log on the phone and the relay service log (`journalctl`) on the host.

### Remote connectivity

Hermes-Relay does **not** ship its own application-layer cryptography. The
operator owns both endpoints and can use Tailscale (managed TLS + tailnet ACL
identity), a reverse proxy with Let's Encrypt, WireGuard or another VPN, or a
Cloudflare Tunnel. The Relay plugin also offers opt-in **Hermes Secure Link**:
one TLS origin whose SPKI pin is imported from the operator-reviewed pairing QR.
Secure Link verifies continuity with that paired endpoint; it does not
independently identify the physical host or make the listener reachable.
Relay, API, and Dashboard keep separate session, bearer, and cookie/native
bearer authentication inside their fixed namespaces. See
[`docs/remote-access.md`](remote-access.md) and the
[`Hermes Secure Link security contract`](security-native-proxy.md).

**Hermes Reach** is an explicitly enabled experimental outbound-only rendezvous
route. It does not move the security
boundary to the broker. The outer broker connection uses WSS, while the Hermes
stream stays inside QR-pinned Secure Link TLS end-to-end. A Reach broker can see
routing identity, source information, timing, and byte counts and can disrupt
availability; it cannot read successfully authenticated inner traffic. Reach
does not provide anonymity or independently identify the physical host. It is
ordered after Tailscale and supported direct TLS routes. See
[`docs/security-broker-transport.md`](security-broker-transport.md).

Multi-endpoint pairing (ADR 24) makes "same phone, different networks" a first-class case: a single QR carries `lan` / `tailscale` / `public` candidates in strict-priority order and the phone re-probes reachability on every network change. A connection can also opt in to **Always connect via Tailscale**, which makes every non-tailnet candidate ineligible for that connection and reports a blocked state instead of downgrading. Per-candidate `transport_hint` drives the plaintext-`ws://` gating — an unencrypted leg is used only after the operator has enabled and acknowledged plain connections. The TOFU cert pin is keyed by `host:port`, so two endpoints pointing at the same hostname share a pin (correct — same cert, same pin) while distinct hostnames each get their own.

## Recommendations for Production Use

1. **Use Tailscale (built-in) or a reverse proxy + Let's Encrypt.** `hermes-relay-tailscale enable` is the shortest path to a managed-TLS remote-access story; Caddy + Let's Encrypt is the shortest path to a real public domain. Optional Hermes Secure Link can add pairing-pinned TLS once the host is already reachable. See [`docs/remote-access.md`](remote-access.md).
2. **Use a strong pairing code**: Don't share your code publicly
3. **Disconnect when idle**: Tap Disconnect in the app when you're not actively using it
4. **Monitor the phone**: Keep the status overlay enabled to see when the bridge is active
5. **Don't pair on public WiFi without a VPN**: Plain `ws://` is vulnerable to interception — pair on a network you trust or front the relay with Tailscale / TLS first.

## Privacy

See [docs/privacy.md](privacy.md) for the full privacy and data handling policy. Key points:

- **No external data transmission** — the app connects only to the Hermes servers you configure
- **Local-only analytics** — Stats for Nerds counters are stored in DataStore on-device, never sent externally
- **Encrypted credential storage** — API keys and session tokens use EncryptedSharedPreferences (AES-256-GCM, hardware-backed Android Keystore)
- **No tracking, ads, or third-party SDKs**
