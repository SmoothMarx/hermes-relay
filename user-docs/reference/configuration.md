# Configuration

Hermes-Relay stores its settings using Android's DataStore, Android Keystore (for session tokens when available), and EncryptedSharedPreferences (fallback). This page documents the available configuration options.

## Connection Settings

These are configured during onboarding or from the **Settings → Gateways** screen. That screen is the single authoritative home for everything connection-related. Each saved Hermes server appears as its own card in the list; the currently active card expands inline to surface its configuration.

Directly beneath **Gateways**, the **Always connect via Tailscale** row opens a
per-connection subpage. It holds the only switch for that setting: while it is on,
that connection uses Tailscale routes only and refuses every other route, showing
a blocked state with remediation (install Tailscale, open Tailscale, add a Tailscale
route, or turn off and retry) instead of falling back. It applies to the active
connection; the connection's **Routes** tab carries a read-only status row that
opens the same subpage. Which apps the device sends through Tailscale is configured
in the Tailscale app's own per-app routing, not here.

Hermes-Relay now treats connection auth as three related but separate contexts:

- **Dashboard sign-in** (`:9119`) — upstream-preferred remote identity for the vanilla dashboard/desktop path. Current gateways use a native bearer when `native_pkce` is advertised; compatibility gateways use exact-origin cookies. Both mint short-lived `/api/ws` tickets for Chat, sessions, Manage, and standard voice. Android supports username/password and redirect providers such as Nous/OIDC for this surface.
- **Direct API connection** (`:8642`) — OpenAI-compatible chat, sessions, and portable API calls for API-only/headless compatibility. If the Hermes API server is configured with `API_SERVER_KEY`, Android stores that bearer key only for Direct API paths.
- **Pairing** (`:8767`) — Relay grants for Terminal, Bridge, proactive Threads, Relay sessions, media inspection/enhancements, and profile memory file editing. Pairing is not required for vanilla Dashboard/API use, but it is required for Relay tools.

**Chat** is the home screen. **Manage** is reached from **Settings → Hermes management**, **Media** sits with the standard Hermes settings, and **Terminal** and **Bridge** live under **Settings → Relay tools** (and deep links); Manage and Bridge each keep a back arrow to Chat. Unpaired devices see a clear **Requires pairing** / **Pair to unlock** gate before those Relay-only screens load.

**Manage** uses the dashboard session, not relay pairing. It covers Skills, Cron jobs, MCP servers, the MCP catalog, Profiles, Models, and Config. Actions that write dashboard state use upstream dashboard endpoints; profile SOUL is view-only here, while SOUL/memory file editing remains a paired power tool.

**On any card (active or not) — the per-connection action row:**
- **Reconnect** (only on Stale state)
- **Rename**, **Re-pair**, **Revoke**, **Remove**

**On the active card — a deep body below the action row.** Each section is headed by a labelMedium header and a one-line caption so the card self-narrates:

- **Overview** — summarizes one Hermes installation by capability: Chat, Manage, Voice, and optional Hermes-Relay extensions. It distinguishes the path being used now from configured fallbacks; a missing API server does not make a normal Dashboard connection look broken.
- **Routes** — **Dashboard & Gateway** shows the normal required address used by Manage, Gateway chat, sessions, voice, and sign-in, with edit and re-check actions. Optional LAN/Tailscale access paths and direct API/Relay compatibility details live below it. Each advertised surface is probed independently; an authenticated Dashboard origin cannot replace API or Relay ownership.
- **Security** — reports protection and credential ownership per surface. Only surfaces currently in use affect the rollup; an available or unreachable fallback stays neutral. Dashboard authentication and Relay pairing tokens/per-channel grants remain separate even when transports share one authority.
- **Advanced** — compatibility and endpoint overrides that most Dashboard/Gateway users do not need:
  - **Optional Direct API** — API Server URL and API Key with **Save & Test**. This preserves the direct host/API-key path for API-only, headless, and compatibility installs.
  - **Direct Relay endpoint** — an explicit standalone Relay URL override with a reachability test and **Disconnect**. Normal same-origin Relay pairing does not require exposing a second user-facing port.
  - **Pair Relay** — opens the shared connection-scoped flow for QR scan, entering a server-issued code, or showing a phone-generated code. Advanced does not maintain a second inline pairing state machine.
  - **Allow plain (unencrypted) connections** toggle — first enable opens a consent dialog with a reason picker (LAN only / Tailscale or VPN / Local dev only). Reason is stored for later but the Transport Security badge usually derives a more accurate label from the live active-route role. Operator intent is the trust model — the toggle gates the UI's ability to save `ws://` / `http://` URLs, nothing server-side.
  - **Disconnect** button — drops the active WSS without clearing the session token.
- **Security** (always visible) — Transport Security badge (🔒 secure / 🔓 plain with reason / 🔓 unknown), Tailscale-detected chip, Hardware-keystore badge, and a **Relay sessions** row that navigates to the full list of phones paired with this server.

| Setting | Storage | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| API Server URL | EncryptedSharedPreferences | Optional advanced/legacy compatibility endpoint for API-only records or explicit Direct API Chat. Normal Dashboard onboarding does not require it, and an unavailable Direct API route does not degrade Dashboard/Gateway readiness. |
| API Key | EncryptedSharedPreferences | Bearer token for API-server authentication. Used by Direct API, not by dashboard login. |
| Dashboard URL | DataStore | The Dashboard/Gateway route entered during normal onboarding; it may be LAN, Tailscale, or public. Redirect providers must still return to the externally reachable Dashboard origin registered as `<public-dashboard-origin>/auth/callback`. Hermes normally derives this from trusted proxy headers; operators use upstream `dashboard.public_url` / `HERMES_DASHBOARD_PUBLIC_URL` only when that reconstruction is unreliable. Native PKCE uses a different advertised origin only for its browser transaction. On the older cookie compatibility flow Android verifies the installation and asks before saving a different authenticated Dashboard origin. Normal setup therefore does not require a second public sign-in field. Public origins require HTTPS, while same-origin or explicitly reviewed literal LAN/Tailscale/loopback HTTP retains upstream's trusted-network mode. |
| Dashboard session cookies | EncryptedSharedPreferences | Compatibility auth cookies for the dashboard/admin server, stored separately from native bearer tokens, API keys, and Relay sessions. Every interactive provider, including password providers, uses native PKCE whenever `/api/status.auth_flows` advertises it; older gateways and client-local native failures use the cookie flow. Cookies stay on the exact host that issued them and are never copied between LAN, Tailscale, public, or derived Dashboard hosts. |
| Relay URL | EncryptedSharedPreferences | Optional Hermes-Relay transport address for Bridge, Terminal, device tools, and Relay sessions. It is recorded only after explicit configuration or pairing; Android does not assume an exposed port, and Dashboard auth never substitutes for Relay pairing/grants. |
| Relay Session Token | **Keystore** (StrongBox when available), with fallback to EncryptedSharedPreferences | Persistent token from relay pairing flow. Migrated automatically from the legacy EncryptedSharedPreferences file on first launch post-upgrade. |
| TOFU Cert Pins | DataStore (`tofu_pins`) | SHA-256 SPKI fingerprints per `host:port`. Recorded on the first successful `wss://` connect, verified on subsequent connects via OkHttp `CertificatePinner`. Wiped explicitly when the user re-pairs via QR (taken as consent to new cert material). |
| Pair TTL Preference | DataStore (`pair_ttl_seconds`) | User's last-selected session TTL on the pair flow. Preselected next time. |
| Plain toggle ack seen | DataStore (`insecure_ack_seen`) | Whether the user has acknowledged the Allow-plain-connections toggle threat model. Per-install; revoke via **Clear data** to reshow. (Key name retains the legacy `insecure_` prefix for migration compatibility.) |
| Plain toggle reason | DataStore (`insecure_reason`) | Reason selected on the plain-toggle ack dialog — `lan_only` / `tailscale_vpn` / `local_dev` / empty. Auto-stamped at pair time when the resolved endpoint's role is `lan` or `tailscale` (cleared on upgrade to a secure endpoint). The Transport Security badge prefers the live active-route role over this stored value. |
| All-plain pairing ack | DataStore (`all_insecure_pair_ack_seen`) | Whether the user has acknowledged the one-time pairing-consent checkbox that appears on step 2 when every route in the scanned QR is plain `ws://` / `http://` (no secure sibling). Per-install. Mixed QRs (LAN + Tailscale) are ungated because the secure route is a safety net. |
| Trusted bridge actions | DataStore (`bridge_trusted_destructive_verbs`) | Set of destructive bridge verbs (e.g. `send_sms`, `call`) that bypass the confirmation overlay because the user ticked "Don't ask again" in a prior confirm. The master-disable toggle and the blocklist still override — trust is for eliminating confirmation fatigue on approved verbs, not a kill-switch bypass. Reset from Bridge → Trusted actions → **Reset**. |
| Notification triggers | DataStore (`notification_triggers`) | Explicit opt-in proactive rules for the Notification companion. Stores `notification_triggers_enabled`, `notification_triggers_kill_switch`, JSON `notification_trigger_rules_json`, and JSON `notification_trigger_activity_log_json` (latest 25 entries). The MVP rule schema is `id`, `label`, `enabled`, `app_package`, optional `title_contains` / `text_contains`, `action=ask_me`, and `require_confirmation=false`. |

### Backups

**Settings → Developer options → Export Settings** writes a full connection backup. It includes saved connection records, route candidates, preferred route, API keys, relay session tokens, device IDs, paired-session metadata, and dashboard cookies. Treat the exported JSON as sensitive credential material. Importing a backup replaces the saved connection list and restores those connection secrets into the app's encrypted stores.

### Pair Flow — TTL Picker

When you scan a pairing QR (or enter a code manually), a **Session TTL Picker** dialog opens before the phone connects to the relay. Options:

- **1 day** — one-shot development sessions. Expires fast, forces frequent re-pair.
- **7 days** — the default for plain `ws://` without Tailscale.
- **30 days** — the default for `wss://` or when Tailscale is detected. Also matches the legacy hardcoded TTL.
- **90 days** / **1 year** — longer-lived operator devices.
- **Never expire** — the device stays paired until you revoke it manually from Relay sessions. Always selectable — the phone treats user intent as the trust model and doesn't gate on transport security. A warning is shown inline.

The default pre-selection depends on the QR's operator-chosen TTL (if any, via `hermes pair --ttl <duration>`), falling back to 30d on secure/Tailscale transports or 7d on plain ws. Your last pick persists as the new default for future pairs.

Per-channel grants (`chat`, `terminal`, `bridge`, `tui`, `voice:config`, `voice:stt`, `voice:tts`) can be pre-set by the operator via `hermes pair --grants terminal=7d,bridge=1d,voice:stt=7d`. The phone displays them on the Relay sessions card as labeled chips with a tap-for-info icon explaining that each grant is a per-feature permission with an independent expiry. Grants cannot outlive the session — they're clamped to the session TTL server-side.

### Relay sessions

**Settings → Connections → [active card] → Security → Relay sessions** (or **Settings → Relay tools → Relay sessions**) opens a full-screen list of every phone currently paired with the relay. This is a Relay tool: if the current connection is not paired, Android shows **Requires pairing** with a **Pair to unlock** action instead of an empty session list. When paired, the screen leads with a short intro paragraph explaining that each row is a server-side session (not a Bluetooth pairing, not an account), then renders one card per session:

- Device name + device ID
- **Current device** badge if this is the device you're looking at the list on
- Transport security badge (Secure (TLS) / Plain (on `<role>`) / Plain (no TLS))
- Session expiry (a date or "Never")
- Per-channel grant chips (`chat`, `terminal`, `bridge`, `tui`, and `voice:*`)
- **Extend** button — opens the same TTL picker dialog used during initial pair, preselected with the current remaining lifetime (or "Never" if already never-expiring). Confirming calls `PATCH /sessions/{token_prefix}` with the new TTL; the server restarts the clock from now and auto-clamps any existing grants to the (possibly new) session lifetime. Also works to **shorten** sessions — pick a shorter duration or "Never" to change the policy without re-pairing.
- **Revoke** button — confirmation dialog, then `DELETE /sessions/{token_prefix}`. Revoking the current device wipes local session token and redirects to pairing flow.

Any paired device can revoke any other. For single-operator deployments (1-2 phones, one host) this is fine; for multi-user deployments a per-device role model is a future refactor (see ADR 15).

## Chat Settings

Available in **Settings > Chat**.

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| Show reasoning | `true` | Display thinking/reasoning blocks above responses |
| Show token usage | `true` | Display input/output token counts and estimated cost |
| Share phone status with agent | `true` | Include mobile context in API-only chats; not sent in standard Gateway chats |
| Tool call display | `Detailed` | How tool calls appear: Off, Compact, or Detailed |
| Personality | Server default | Active personality from `config.agent.personalities` via `GET /api/config` |

## Media Settings

Available in **Settings → Hermes → Media**. Controls how the app fetches,
protects, and caches files the agent sends back through chat. Current upstream
Dashboard file/download/stream routes are preferred for ordinary `MEDIA:` paths,
generated files, audio, video, and file links. A paired Relay can still resolve
explicit `hermes-relay://` tokens, add sensitivity metadata, and support older
hosts. Both routes land bytes in the same app cache and share them with external
viewers through `FileProvider` (authority `${applicationId}.fileprovider`).

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| Max inbound attachment size | `25 MB` | Hard cap on fetches. The app downloads the body, and if it exceeds this cap the attachment flips to FAILED with a "File too large" message. Range: 5–100 MB. |
| Auto-fetch threshold | `2 MB` | *Persisted but not enforced today — forward-compatibility placeholder.* Intended to be a soft ceiling above which the app shows "Tap to download" instead of auto-fetching. Currently only the cellular toggle + the hard max cap are enforced. Range: 0–50 MB. |
| Auto-fetch on cellular | `off` | When off + the device is on a cellular network, attachments stay in LOADING state with a "Tap to download" affordance rather than auto-downloading. When on, cellular is treated the same as Wi-Fi. |
| Cached media cap | `200 MB` | Maximum total size of `cacheDir/hermes-media/`. Oldest files (by mtime) are evicted when the cache would exceed this. Range: 50–500 MB. |
| Clear cached media | — | Button. Deletes every file in `cacheDir/hermes-media/` and shows a toast with the freed byte count. |

**What works:** Images render inline (same path as outbound attachments — `BitmapFactory.decodeByteArray` + `asImageBitmap`, no Coil/Glide added). Video / audio / PDF / text / generic files render as tap-to-open file cards that fire `ACTION_VIEW` with `FLAG_GRANT_READ_URI_PERMISSION` against the `FileProvider` URI.

**What doesn't work yet:**
- Session replay across relay restarts. The `MediaRegistry` is in-memory on the relay side, so tokens stored in persisted message history become stale when the relay restarts. Scrolling back into a prior session renders a `⚠️ Image unavailable` placeholder for any stale token. Phone-side persistent caching (indexed by token or content hash) is the planned fix; filed as a follow-up.
- Auto-fetch threshold enforcement (see table above).

**Bare-path markers (`MEDIA:/abs/path.ext`) — the LLM's native format.**
Upstream Hermes instructs the agent to emit markers in this form. Android first
resolves them through the authenticated Dashboard file routes, matching official
Desktop. Relay `GET /media/by-path` is an older-host compatibility fallback;
`MEDIA:hermes-relay://<token>` remains available for tools that intentionally
pre-register a Relay file.

**If no compatible source is available**, the app shows one stable, path-free
file-unavailable card instead of raw marker text or a global Relay error.
Upstream authentication/policy failures remain actionable; an unconfigured
optional Relay is not itself a transfer failure.

## Appearance Settings

Available in **Settings > Appearance**.

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| Theme | `system` | Light, dark, or follow system setting |
| Dynamic colors | `true` | Use Material You wallpaper-based colors (Android 12+) |
| Language | System default | System default, English, Deutsch, Español, 日本語, Português (Brasil), or 简体中文; synchronized with Android per-app language settings |

## Session State

These are managed automatically by the app.

| Key | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| Last active session | Session ID to resume on app restart |
| Onboarding complete | Whether the user has completed initial setup |
| Last seen version | Version string for What's New auto-show |

## Analytics (In-Memory)

The Stats for Nerds section in Settings shows performance data collected in-memory. This data is **not persisted** and resets on app restart. No data is sent off-device.

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| TTFT | Time to first token (ms) |
| Completion time | Total response time (ms) |
| Token usage | Input/output tokens per message |
| Health latency | API health check round-trip time (ms) |
| Stream success rate | Percentage of streams that completed without error |

## Server-Side Configuration

### Hermes API Server

The API server is part of `hermes gateway` and configured via `~/.hermes/.env`:

```bash
# Required for Hermes-Relay
API_SERVER_ENABLED=true
API_SERVER_KEY=your-secret-key
API_SERVER_HOST=0.0.0.0
API_SERVER_PORT=8642
```

### Relay Server

The relay server is a **separate service** (canonically at `plugin/relay/` with a thin `relay_server/` compat shim) that handles terminal and bridge channels over WSS. Only needed if you use those features.

**Quick start:**

```bash
# If you installed the hermes-relay plugin:
hermes relay start --no-ssl

# Or directly from a repo checkout:
python -m plugin.relay --no-ssl
```

`RELAY_HOST` and `RELAY_PORT` are read by **both** the relay server itself and the pair command (`hermes pair` / `/hermes-relay-pair`; `hermes-pair` remains a compatibility shim) — the pair command uses them to locate the local relay when pre-registering a pairing code, so if you run the relay on a non-default port, make sure the same values are in the environment when you invoke pairing.

**Environment variables:**

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `RELAY_HOST` | `0.0.0.0` | Bind address (relay) / relay host used by the pair command |
| `RELAY_PORT` | `8767` | Listen port (relay) / relay port probed by the pair command |
| `RELAY_SSL_CERT` | — | TLS certificate path |
| `RELAY_SSL_KEY` | — | TLS private key path |
| `RELAY_WEBAPI_URL` | `http://localhost:8642` | Hermes API Server URL |
| `RELAY_HERMES_CONFIG` | `~/.hermes/config.yaml` | Hermes config (for profile loading) |
| `RELAY_LOG_LEVEL` | `INFO` | Logging level |
| `RELAY_TERMINAL_SHELL` | _auto (`$SHELL`)_ | Absolute path to the shell spawned for terminal sessions |
| `RELAY_PAIRING_CODE` | — | Pre-register a pairing code at startup (same effect as `--pairing-code`) |
| `RELAY_TRUST_PROXY_HEADERS` | `0` | Trust `X-Forwarded-Proto: https` from your own reverse proxy for Hermes API-key auth on `/voice/*` |
| `RELAY_ALLOW_INSECURE_API_BEARER` | `0` | Dev-only startup escape hatch for API-key voice auth over non-loopback plain HTTP. For a running relay, use `hermes relay insecure-api-key on` and `off` instead. |
| `RELAY_PROVIDER_USAGE_ENABLED` | `0` | Explicitly allow paired devices to read provider account usage and quota metadata through the Relay compatibility endpoint. Provider keys alone never enable this disclosure. |
| `RELAY_MEDIA_MAX_SIZE_MB` | `100` | Per-file size cap on `POST /media/register` (MediaRegistry, used for inbound media delivery — see ADR 14) |
| `RELAY_MEDIA_TTL_SECONDS` | `86400` | How long a registered media entry stays valid before the registry evicts it |
| `RELAY_MEDIA_LRU_CAP` | `500` | Max entries in the media registry before oldest-eviction kicks in |
| `RELAY_MEDIA_ALLOWED_ROOTS` | — | Additional absolute directory roots allowed on `/media/register` (colon-separated on Unix, `os.pathsep` on other platforms). Extends the auto-derived defaults (`tempfile.gettempdir()` + `HERMES_WORKSPACE` or `~/.hermes/workspace/`). |

The authenticated Relay Dashboard plugin can also return provider usage to a
signed-in Dashboard client and resolve the active Codex pool credential from
the live session. `RELAY_PROVIDER_USAGE_ENABLED` controls only the standalone
paired-device `/usage/providers` fallback; neither surface returns provider
credentials.

**Pairing alphabet:** As of 2026-04-11, the relay accepts any 6-character code from `A-Z / 0-9` (36 chars). The earlier "no ambiguous 0/O/1/I" 32-char restriction was dropped once the pairing flow became QR + HTTP — the phone-side generator in `AuthManager.kt` uses the full alphabet, and the restriction silently rejected roughly one in eight valid codes.

For Docker, systemd, and TLS setup, see [docs/relay-server.md](https://github.com/Codename-11/hermes-relay/blob/main/docs/relay-server.md).

### Phone Threads (proactive messaging) — Beta

Available under **Settings → Relay tools → Threads**. The optional **phone
platform** lets the Hermes agent proactively message your paired device —
`send_message target=phone`, cron `deliver=phone`, and named Threads in chat. It
is off by default; opt in via `~/.hermes/.env` and restart the gateway:

```bash
PHONE_ENABLED=1
```

**The home channel is auto-configured — no `/sethome` needed.** Other platforms (Telegram, Discord) make you run `/sethome` to choose *which* of their many chats receives cron results and cross-platform messages. A paired phone is a single device, so its home channel is set automatically when you enable the platform. To give it a friendly display name (used as the notification title and the Thread label), set it in the dashboard under **Relay → Management → Home channel**, or directly in `.env`:

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `PHONE_ENABLED` | _unset_ | Set to `1` to let the agent proactively message the phone |
| `PHONE_HOME_CHANNEL_NAME` | `Phone` | Display name for the phone home channel / Threads label |

Name changes apply after the next gateway restart. The underlying channel id stays fixed (`phone`) so existing Threads are never orphaned.

### Profiles & the relay

If you run multiple Hermes **profiles** (agents), two things are easy to conflate:

- **You pair once.** The relay is a single shared service (`:8767`) with one pairing store. A device pairs with the relay, not with a profile — chat, bridge, terminal, and voice all ride that one relay regardless of which agent you talk to.
- **The plugin is installed once, enabled per profile.** The plugin *code* lives at a single global path (`~/.hermes/plugins/hermes-relay`). But each profile's `config.yaml` has its own `plugins.enabled` list, so an agent only sees the relay's tools (and can proactively message the phone) if *its* profile enables `hermes-relay`.

So a multi-agent host never re-pairs, but may want the plugin enabled for every agent. Check and fix that in one step:

```bash
hermes relay profiles list          # show enablement per profile
hermes relay profiles enable --all  # enable hermes-relay in every profile
hermes relay profiles enable gary   # …or just one profile
```

Each edited config is backed up to `<config>.yaml.bak`. Restart the affected gateway afterward (`systemctl --user restart hermes-gateway`) to load the plugin.

### Keeping the relay plugin updated

The Android app, Relay plugin, and CLI+UI have **independent versions** — they do not need to match. To see whether a newer plugin release exists:

```bash
hermes relay update-check           # compares your version to the latest plugin release
```

The dashboard's **Relay → Management** tab shows the same as a "Plugin version" card with a **Check** button. When an update is available, apply it with whichever matches your install, then restart the gateway:

```bash
hermes plugins update hermes-relay   # native plugin install
hermes-relay-update                  # full-relay installer (install.sh)
systemctl --user restart hermes-gateway
```

### Compatibility Hook

The legacy `hermes_relay_bootstrap.pth` hook is optional. It fills route gaps for
older Hermes builds and installs slash-command middleware, but modern Vanilla Hermes
chat, Manage, and dashboard voice do not depend on it.

```bash
hermes relay compat status
hermes relay compat install   # only when an older server needs it
hermes relay compat remove
```

The compat command manages only the `.pth` startup hook in the target Python
environment. New hooks load the plugin-owned bootstrap implementation from the
installed Relay plugin; older hooks that import the top-level bootstrap shim are
still removable. Legacy service units, shell shims, root package installs, and
external skill-path entries are still cleaned up by `uninstall.sh` when they
were created by the legacy installer.

Cleanup is intentionally split: `hermes plugins remove hermes-relay` removes a
plugin-manager install, `hermes relay compat remove --all` removes optional
compat hooks, and `bash ~/.hermes/hermes-relay/uninstall.sh` removes legacy
installer artifacts such as the systemd user service, shell shims, editable
Python package, external skill path, and clone. For a copy/paste cleanup handoff,
see the [Agent Cleanup Prompt](/reference/agent-cleanup-prompt).

### Skills (`external_dirs`)

Hermes-Relay's `/hermes-relay-pair` slash command is implemented as a skill at `~/.hermes/hermes-relay/skills/devops/hermes-relay-pair/SKILL.md`. Rather than hand-copying it into `~/.hermes/skills/`, the installer registers the clone's `skills/` directory in your `~/.hermes/config.yaml`:

```yaml
skills:
  external_dirs:
    - ~/.hermes/hermes-relay/skills
```

This is the canonical Hermes distribution pattern for plugin-bundled skills — hermes-agent scans `external_dirs` on every invocation, so a `git pull` inside `~/.hermes/hermes-relay/` immediately updates the skill with no extra steps. (There is no `hermes skills update` flow for `external_dirs`-based skills; update = `git pull`.)

If you already have an `external_dirs` list, the installer appends to it idempotently. If you removed the entry by hand and want it back, re-run the one-liner or add the line manually and restart hermes-agent.

## Network Security Config

The app permits cleartext at the Android network-security layer so LAN, emulator, and trusted-VPN setups can still be configured. App-level controls decide when plain routes are actually used:

- Plain `ws://` relay routes require the app's explicit plain-connection consent.
- API-key voice over non-loopback plain HTTP is blocked by the relay unless the operator temporarily enables `hermes relay insecure-api-key on`.
- Tailscale and public reverse-proxy setups should use HTTPS/WSS.

For remote access, prefer `hermes-relay-tailscale enable`, which maps dedicated
tailnet HTTPS `:10443` to local Dashboard `:9119` and its same-origin Relay
ingress without colliding with a reverse proxy on `:443`. Direct API on
`:8642` is optional; direct Relay `:8767` is legacy-only.
